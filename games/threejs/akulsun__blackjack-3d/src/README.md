## Features

- **3D Table & Atmosphere**: Realistic casino table with custom-felt tones (Emerald Green, Sapphire Navy, Ruby Burgundy, and Onyx Charcoal), dynamic camera transitions, and cast shadows.
- **Procedural High-Resolution Cards**: 52-card deck generated directly via HTML5 Canvas with sharp vector pips, custom royal court designs, authentic back filigree, and physical thickness.
- **Comprehensive Rules Engine**:
  - **Dealer Rules**: Stand on all 17s (**S17**) or Hit Soft 17 (**H17**).
  - **Blackjack Payouts**: Standard **3:2** or Vegas **6:5**.
  - **Shoe Configuration**: 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 deck shoe with realistic cut-card penetration and Fisher-Yates shuffling.
  - **Player Actions**: Hit, Stand, Double Down, Split (up to 3 splits / 4 hands), Late Surrender, and 2:1 Insurance against dealer Aces.
- **Animated Discard Tray & Card Cleanup**: Authentically styled clear-acrylic discard rack positioned on the dealer's right. When a round finishes, cards automatically lift, scoop into a neat stack at the center felt with synthesized sliding friction audio, and slide into the discard tray. Features an automatic 1.8-second idle cleanup timer or instantaneous expedited sweep on Deal / Rebet & Deal, with a physical discard stack inside the tray that visibly accumulates and resets on shoe reshuffle.
- **Synthesized Web Audio**: Procedural sound effects using the Web Audio API for card sliding, felt taps, chip placement, winning fanfares, and busts — zero external audio assets required.
- **Fast Casino Flow & Quality of Life**: Instant "Rebet" and "Rebet & Deal" one-click actions, 2× bet multiplier, full desktop keyboard shortcuts (`Space`, `H`, `S`, `D`, `P`, `U`, `R`, `X`, `C`, `1-4`, `Y/N`), intuitive mobile touch gestures (Swipe Down = Hit, Swipe Across = Stand, Swipe Up = Double, Two-finger Tap = Split), and an interactive Controls Guide modal.
- **Casino Loyalty & XP Career Progression**: Permanent VIP loyalty system based on cumulative XP earned through wagers, round wins, natural blackjacks, streaks, and basic strategy decisions — never demoting when placing bets. Unlocks dynamic reload allowances ($1,000 up to $25,000 for Diamond Whales), audio-visual level-up celebrations, and table felt perks across 5 tiers (Bronze Roller, Silver Club, Gold VIP, Platinum Elite, Diamond Whale) with real-time HUD XP progress tracking and career analytics.
- **High-Roller Chip Denominations & Interactive Betting**: Extended chip stack array with $1, $5, $25, $100, $500, and $1,000 chips. Supports direct 3D raycast interaction to click table chip stacks to bet, and click active bets in the betting circle to remove or adjust chips.
- **Table HUD & Settings Modal**: Responsive controls for denomination bets ($1, $5, $25, $100, $500, $1,000), bankroll reload, animation speed adjustment (Normal, Fast, Turbo), and audio controls.
- **Card Inspector Grid**: Dedicated `/debug.html` grid displaying all 52 high-resolution procedural card faces with filtering.
