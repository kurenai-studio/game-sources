## What Solver.solve found (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md 4.4). A level whose search did not complete
## is never shown.

## A winning order was found.
var solved: bool = false
## The search finished: if solved, fewest_tray_uses is proven; if not, the level has no
## solution. False if it stopped at max_states.
var complete: bool = false
## The fewest tray uses any solution needs (-1 if not solved).
var fewest_tray_uses: int = -1
## A solution with that many tray uses: screw ids in tap order.
var solution := PackedInt32Array()
## The search stopped because every solution needs more tray uses than the cap it was given
## (complete is true then: that much is proven).
var over_cap: bool = false
## Distinct states the search reached.
var states: int = 0
## Whether the novice policy (GDD 6.4) wins.
var novice_won: bool = false
## The novice's survival (GDD 6.4.1, G9a): the taps it makes before the level is lost, every
## tap counted (into a box or into the tray), the tap after which R23 holds included. The
## screw count when it wins.
var novice_taps: int = 0
## Where the solution makes its last tray use (GDD 6.4.1, G9b): the tap number, 1 to the screw
## count, of its last tap that sends a screw to the tray. 0 if it makes none or nothing was
## solved.
var last_tray_use: int = 0
## The most screws in the tray at once along the solution (after each tap's jumps into arriving
## boxes); 0 if nothing was solved. G10a reads it. The least peak over every solution can be
## lower: see Generator.peak_holds.
var peak_tray: int = 0
## The trap measure: the share of careless playouts that lose (see Solver).
var trap: float = 0.0
## Wall-clock milliseconds, for reports only. Nothing may depend on it.
var ms: int = 0
