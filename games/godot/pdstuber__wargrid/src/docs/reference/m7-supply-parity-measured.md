# M7 supply cycle measured in Zero Hour (2026-11-07, narrowed sweep)

Status: harness extended and working; the narrowed sweep ran as parallel instances (ports via `ZH_PARITY_PORT`, no clashes seen with 5-8 concurrent games). Labels: **measured (source build)**, **formula** ([m7-economy-parity.md](m7-economy-parity.md) section 3), **Wargrid today** (headless scratch sim on the working tree, see below), **unverified**. Zero Hour names appear only here as evidence.

## Provenance

- Wargrid tree: `b7c9ae3` on `m7-factions` plus uncommitted work of other agents (definitions with `SOURCE_FOOTPRINT` 4x5) and the uncommitted harness change.
- Fork: `~/projects/GeneralsGameCode-macOS` branch `wargrid-parity` @ `eb595cfc9`, binary `build/apple-arm64-release/GeneralsMD/Release/generalszh_api`, always `-headless -noaudio`. No fork change was needed.
- Scenarios `collect_<chinook|truck|worker>_<6|12|30|0>` and `_12_x2` in `tools/zh_parity/parity.py` (`collect()`), metrics in `analyze.py` (`collecting()`; `analyze.py --traces DIR` prints one JSON line per `collect_*` trace). Distances are centre to centre in cells (6/12/30 = 150/300/750 units); `_0` = nearest legal depot spot found by retrying `build_structure` every 5 units (the API rejects illegal spots); `_x2` = a second collector trained at the depot.
- Setup per run: neutral `SupplyDock` (400 boxes, INI), one builder (dozer or worker) builds the faction power plant if needed, then the depot; the depot's free collector starts the loop by itself. Standard skirmish money (10000, read from `/players`). Credits seen as increases of the API player's money each logic frame; a deposit is one increase. Rate = credits after the first deposit / frames between first and last deposit x 1800.
- Scratch traces: `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-pdstuber-projects-wargrid/77c02dce-6b2d-4f3e-b2bf-73a55134f5e7/scratchpad/` : `t0/collect_truck_6.tsv`, `r4/` (chinook 6/12/12_x2, truck 12, worker 6/12; first worker_0 from a scan starting at 30 units), `r5/collect_worker_0.tsv` (scan from 5 units, final). Nothing written to `~/CnC/parity/traces`.

## Harness findings (measured)

- A raw `spawn` of a depot gives a collector that never deposited (stood about 45 units away, money unchanged in 1400 frames). A raw-spawned extra collector never self-starts. So depots are built by a builder and extra collectors come from `train_unit`.
- The API player's faction is random per game; spawned builders of the wanted faction work regardless.
- Closest legal depot: the GLA stash is accepted by the API legality check at 90 units (3.6 cells) from a 400-box dock (scan 5-unit steps from 5; nearer spots were refused or `buildObjectNow failed`). A first scan starting at 30 units reported 30 units, which the later scan contradicts; treat 90 as the answer. The Chinook and truck `_0` rows were still running.
- Killing Fields has no 1000-unit strip that is flat to 2 height units; the 30-cell rows use a 60-wide strip with slope up to 12 (a gentle slope, affects speed little).

## Pooled results (ZH measured, source build; 3 runs per row, uncapped engine loop)

Method: each run builds a depot (builder), then records one collector (or several) for at least 8 deposits per collector; 3 independent games per row (random faction and seed per game). Pooled = all credits after each run's first deposit / all frames first to last deposit x 1800; spread = (max - min) / pooled across the 3 runs. Phases = median cycle frames (travel / standing nearer the pile / standing nearer the depot; position-based, includes dock handling). Wargrid today = scratch sim `wg_supply2.gd` on the working tree (base `b7c9ae3` plus uncommitted tree), c-c 6.5 / 12.5 / 30.5 cells = 162.5 / 312.5 / 762.5 units. Traces: scratchpad `.../scratchpad/U/rep1..rep3` (`.tsv` + `.log` per run). Fork `eb595cfc9`, run `-headless -noaudio`, `GEN_FPS_CAP=0`.

Findings:
- **Worker x4 / x1 = 3.66 (spread 1.1 %), above the plan's 3.6 stop line by 1.8 %.** Two workers give 1.97x, four 3.66x: ZH holds the dock per collector, and 3.66x fits a held pile: while one worker loads or unloads, the others walk. The sub-4x scaling is the queue at the pile, not an overlap of docking. Whether 3.66 is "above 3.6" is inside the noise of a 1 % spread; it is the sign, not the margin, that matters for the fold rule.
- Chinook: the 762.5-unit pooled 1181 matches the plan's constant-model prediction of 1180 (identical in all 3 runs; Chinook runs are fully deterministic here). Multi-Chinook scaling is weak: 2 give 1.89x, 4 give 2.12x one.
- Truck: scales to 2.01x with 2 and 3.39x with 4.
- Truck phases differ between sweeps: capped-loop runs earlier today gave 424 (186 / 188 / 50) at 162.5; this uncapped sweep 410 (172 / 188 / 50), and the 6-cell run 388-389 (150-151 / 188 / 50) against 409 (171 / 188 / 50) in the first capped run. Chinook and worker phases are identical between the capped and uncapped sweeps. The truck differences are 14-21 travel frames, i.e. the truck's route depends on something that varies between sweeps (random faction and builder position, strip choice); treat the truck pooled value as +-3 % uncertain, which is smaller than every Wargrid deviation but matters at the 5 % gate for the 762.5 row (+7 %).
- Wargrid worker x4 and the worker 762.5 rows need harness work (spawn spacing, a collector that keeps working beyond the 700-unit scan).

## Legal minimum depot-to-pile distance

Source-read, not measured, unverified: the rule and its derivation are in [m7-placement-rules](m7-placement-rules.md) (rule 1). The API's own legality check could not measure it (it accepted overlapping placements 5 units from a spawned dock), so the closest-legal (`_0`) rows were dropped.

## Unverified / missing

Harness usage and API quirks: [zero-hour-parity-harness](zero-hour-parity-harness.md). Not run: worker at 762.5 units; Wargrid worker x4; map-placed-pile control (the spawned neutral `SupplyDock` may not be a pathfinding obstacle); legal minimum distances; capped-versus-uncapped equality for the truck. The Wargrid scratch script `wg_supply2.gd` lives only in the scratch dir.
