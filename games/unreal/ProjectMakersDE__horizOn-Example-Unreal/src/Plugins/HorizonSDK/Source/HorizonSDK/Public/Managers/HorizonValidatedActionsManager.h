/**
 * Validated Actions Manager for the horizOn SDK (TASK-883 Part 1, TASK-887 Part 2, TASK-888 Part 3,
 * TASK-911 run start context and sus runs).
 *
 * A run starts with a single use ticket and a server seed (StartRun). The game seeds its
 * deterministic randomness with the seed, records its input log and submits the result
 * with the SHA-256 of that log (SubmitValidated). The server checks the rules of the API
 * key before anything is written and answers with a machine readable `code` on rejection.
 *
 * The manager keeps the started run as the current run. A submit that used up the ticket
 * (accepted, 422 TICKET_* codes, 422 rule and value rejections, 403 SCORE_LIMIT_REACHED)
 * clears it. Checks the server runs before it touches the ticket keep the run, so the game
 * may retry with the same ticket: 404 LEADERBOARD_NOT_FOUND, 422 LEADERBOARD_MISMATCH,
 * 400 SCORE_REQUIRED, 400 PLAYER_NAME_REQUIRED, 403 PLAYER_BANNED (a player banned from the
 * board; the ticket stays usable after an unban, DiscardRun drops it), and also network errors,
 * 401, 429 and 5xx. The run is also cleared on sign-out and when another player signs in.
 *
 * Server-owned state (Part 2): the rules of the API key can define values (currency, loot)
 * that only the server writes. A run earns or spends them through `Earned` of the submit;
 * the accepted result carries the state after the run (Result.State). GetState reads the
 * state at any time. The manager caches the last known state (GetCurrentState()); there is
 * no method that writes it.
 *
 * Evidence (Part 3): the server can ask for the input log of an accepted run
 * (Result.Evidence.bRequired, for example a flagged run or a run in the board's top N). When the
 * run was submitted with the raw bytes (SubmitValidated) and bAutoUploadEvidence is on, the
 * manager uploads the log right away. After SubmitValidatedWithHash the game calls
 * UploadEvidence(Result.Evidence.RunId, Log) itself before Result.Evidence.UploadBefore (24 h).
 * Upload outcomes arrive through OnEvidenceUploaded / OnEvidenceUploadFailed and never change
 * the submit result.
 *
 * Run start context and sus runs (TASK-911): StartRun can declare what the run starts from
 * (FHorizonRunContext). Result.bSus marks an accepted run that crossed a soft threshold; the
 * server keeps it for a review and requests its log through Result.Evidence like a top N record.
 *
 * Every call needs a signed-in player and sends the player session (Authorization: Bearer).
