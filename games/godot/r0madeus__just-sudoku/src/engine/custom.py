# Slimmed Godot 4.7 export template for Just Sudoku: a 2D game on the Compatibility (GLES3)
# renderer, offline, with no audio files (sounds are generated in code). Build with:

# The official template carries 3D, physics, navigation, XR, Vulkan and ~40 modules the game
# never uses; leaving them out is most of the size. tests/test_engine_profile.gd checks that
# nothing the game relies on is listed here as disabled.
