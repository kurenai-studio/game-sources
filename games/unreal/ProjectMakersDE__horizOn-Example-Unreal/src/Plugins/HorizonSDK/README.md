# horizOn SDK for Unreal Engine

The horizOn SDK is a fully-featured Unreal Engine plugin that connects your game to the horizOn backend-as-a-service platform. It provides authentication, cloud saves, leaderboards, remote configuration, in-game news, gift code redemption, player feedback, and server-side user logging -- all accessible from both C++ and Blueprints.

## Features

- **Authentication** -- Anonymous, email, Google, and Apple sign-up / sign-in with automatic session caching.
- **Cloud Save** -- Save and load player data in JSON (string) or binary format.
- **Leaderboard** -- Submit scores, retrieve top entries, player rank, and surrounding entries with in-memory caching.
- **Remote Config** -- Typed key-value retrieval (string, int, float, bool) with cache support.
- **Localization** -- Translated strings in 15 languages with an active language and caching.
- **News** -- Fetch and display in-game news entries with language filtering and 5-minute TTL cache.
- **Gift Codes** -- Validate and redeem promotional codes; codes with `grants` unlock cosmetics.
- **Player Profile** -- Avatar, frame and up to three badges per player, cosmetic unlocks, shown on every leaderboard entry.
- **Validated Actions** -- Server-checked runs: a single use ticket with a server seed, a validated submit with the SHA-256 of the input log, rule rejections with a machine readable code, server-owned values (currency, loot) that only accepted runs change, and the input log uploaded as evidence when the server asks for it.
- **Feedback** -- Submit bug reports, feature requests, and general feedback with optional device info.
- **User Logs** -- Send structured log entries (info, warning, error) to the server for analytics and debugging.
- **Crash Reporting** -- Capture crashes and non-fatal exceptions with breadcrumbs and custom keys.
- **Email Sending** -- Trigger transactional emails through Dashboard templates, immediate or scheduled.

## Requirements

- Unreal Engine **5.5** or later
- A horizOn project with an API key (obtain from the horizOn dashboard)

## Installation

1. Copy the `HorizonSDK` folder into your project's `Plugins/` directory.
2. Open your project in Unreal Editor.
3. Go to **Edit > Plugins**, search for "horizOn SDK", and enable it.
4. Restart the editor when prompted.

## Quick Start (C++)

```cpp
#include "HorizonSubsystem.h"

// Get the subsystem from any Actor or UObject with world context
UHorizonSubsystem* Horizon = GetGameInstance()->GetSubsystem<UHorizonSubsystem>();

// Listen for the connection result (OnConnected must be a UFUNCTION)
Horizon->OnConnected.AddDynamic(this, &AMyActor::OnConnected);

// Connect to the backend
Horizon->ConnectToServer();

// In AMyActor::OnConnected(): sign up anonymously
Horizon->Auth->SignUpAnonymous(TEXT("Player1"),
    FOnAuthComplete::CreateLambda([](bool bSuccess)
    {
        // Handle result
    }));

// Submit a leaderboard score
Horizon->Leaderboard->SubmitScore(42000,
    FOnRequestComplete::CreateLambda([](bool bSuccess, const FString& Error)
    {
        // Handle result
    }));
```

## Quick Start (Blueprints)

1. Use the **"Connect to horizOn Server"** async node to connect to the server.
2. Use **"Sign Up Anonymous"** or **"Sign In Email"** to authenticate.
3. Call any feature node (**"Submit Leaderboard Score"**, **"Cloud Save Data"**, **"Load News"**, etc.).

All async nodes expose **On Success** and **On Failure** execution pins for easy error handling.

## Configuration

Open **Project Settings > Plugins > horizOn SDK** to set:

- **API Key** -- Your project API key.
- **Backend Hosts** -- One or more backend URLs, for example `https://horizon.pm`. Empty by default, so set or import it before connecting. Multiple hosts enable automatic ping-based selection.
- **Connection Timeout**, **Max Retries**, **Retry Delay** -- Network resilience settings.
- **Log Level** -- Control SDK log verbosity.

Alternatively, use **Tools > horizOn > Import Config...** to import a JSON config file from the horizOn dashboard.

## Hello horizOn

The fastest way to see the SDK working end to end. `AHelloHorizonActor` runs a
minimal flow on Play: connect, anonymous sign-up, leaderboard score submit, and
a result message in the log and on screen.

1. Enable the horizOn SDK plugin under **Edit > Plugins** and restart the editor.
2. Set your **API Key** and **Backend Hosts** in **Project Settings > Plugins > horizOn SDK**.
3. Drop **AHelloHorizonActor** into a level and press Play.

Source: `Source/HorizonSDK/Public/Examples/HelloHorizon/HelloHorizonActor.h` and the matching `.cpp` under `Private/`.

## Per-Feature Examples

Each feature ships a small, self-contained example actor under
`Source/HorizonSDK/Public/Examples/` (with matching `.cpp` files under
`Private/Examples/`). Drop one into a level and press Play; it runs the minimal
flow for that feature and logs the outcome on the `LogTemp` channel. Every actor
header documents what it does, where to set the API key, and the expected log
output.

| Feature | Example actor |
|---|---|
| Auth (Anonymous + Email) | `AHorizonAuthExample` |
| Leaderboards | `AHorizonLeaderboardExample` |
| Cloud Save | `AHorizonCloudSaveExample` |
| Crash Reporting | `AHorizonCrashReportingExample` |
| User Logs | `AHorizonUserLogsExample` |
| Remote Config | `AHorizonRemoteConfigExample` |
| Localization | `AHorizonLocalizationExample` |
| News | `AHorizonNewsExample` |
| Email Sending | `AHorizonEmailSendingExample` |
| Gift Codes | `AHorizonGiftCodesExample` |
| Feedback | `AHorizonFeedbackExample` |
| Player Profile | `AHorizonPlayerProfileExample` |
| Validated Actions | `AHorizonValidatedActionsExample` |

The `AHorizonEmailSendingExample` and `AHorizonGiftCodesExample` actors expose
editable properties (recipient user ID, template slug, gift code) that you need
to set to real values from your horizOn Dashboard before running them.
`AHorizonPlayerProfileExample` needs at least one free avatar in the cosmetics
catalog of your API key (horizOn Dashboard).
`AHorizonValidatedActionsExample` runs without setup (no rule set means default
rules); its `LeaderboardKey` property selects the board, empty runs without one.
Set `ValueKey` to a value defined in the rules of your API key to earn server-owned
values; `bMirrorToCloudSave` writes the state mirror to the cloud save.
It logs evidence requests and uploads (set the board's evidence top N above 0 in the
horizOn Dashboard to see one); `bUploadEvidenceManually` shows the `UploadEvidence` path.

Groups are available through `UHorizonSubsystem::Groups`: typed membership, bounded member
pages, invitations/requests, roles and leadership transfer. Every mutation keeps the explicit
original revision/request identity and sends once. Free data uses immutable `FHorizonGroupJsonData`
so large numbers and legal JSON keys survive unchanged. See `Docs/QUICKSTART.md` and the durable
`AHorizonGroupsExample` for explicit two-player UI actions and uncertain-result reconciliation.
