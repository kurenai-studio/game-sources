# Changelog

Player-facing changes are recorded here and used by the release script. New changes
go under **Unreleased**. Version numbers are assigned automatically when publishing;
see the release workflow in [README.md](README.md#automatic-versions-and-changelog).

This history starts with v0.0.14. Earlier releases retain their original notes on GitHub.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Automatic browser-build updates on itch.io once publishing is configured.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- An Achievements menu shows your first tower purchase and each boss defeated in unassisted play, with a popup when you unlock one and community completion counts on the website. Unlocks stay on your device across gameplay resets and retry syncing when you reconnect.
- Touchscreen controls: steer with a floating thumb joystick, change brightness while moving, pause with an on-screen button, and swipe through readable preparation menus.
- The Rainkeeper's rain strikes now play one short wet impact sound as each pool appears.

### Changed

- Flare now deals twice the damage in a wider area, with a simpler pickup description.
- Leaderboards now combine patch releases into one board per minor version, such as v0.0.x, showing each device's best published run across those patches. v0.1.x starts a separate board.
- The browser game's bottom-right label now shows the build version instead of a source-download link.
- The Rainkeeper now rests for four seconds between trios of rain strikes, giving you more time to return to your turrets.

### Fixed

- Settings now has an always-visible Back button and readable, swipeable touchscreen pages, so phone players can return to preparation or the paused game.

## [0.0.29] - 2026-09-11

- No player-facing changes recorded for this release.

## [0.0.28] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Released the original game code and assets under GPLv3, with matching game source and third-party notices included with builds.

## [0.0.27] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Included game license terms and third-party credits with releases, explicitly allowing gameplay videos and streams, including monetized content.

## [0.0.26] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Powerups now keep spawning throughout the run instead of stopping after three minutes.
- Kindling now lasts 12 seconds, Sentinel 15 seconds, and Stillness 5 seconds.

### Fixed

- Controller menus now start with a useful selection, return to the button that opened a submenu, and recover selection when a control disappears or becomes unavailable.
- Fixed a game freeze and runaway memory use when enemies die and new ones arrive during Stillness.

## [0.0.25] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Runs using Ember Pot can now be published to the leaderboard, with Ember Pots shown in shared turret layouts.

## [0.0.24] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- Reduced rendering overhead in crowded fights, including basic enemies and animated turret range indicators.

## [0.0.23] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Added an Assistance submenu with half-price upgrades, a shorter night (bosses at 2:30, 5:00, and 7:30), and half-speed enemies and projectiles. Assisted progress cannot publish leaderboard records, even after assists are turned off; reset progress to return to eligible play.
- Added damage-taken options (75%, 50%, or invincible) for assisted play.
- Added visual accessibility options for stronger danger cues, reduced decorative effects and flashes, and hiding turret range circles while retaining placement guides. Visual preferences keep leaderboard eligibility.

### Changed

- Removed the Done button from Settings; use Escape or controller Back to return.

## [0.0.22] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Added Ember Pot, an area-damage turret whose lobbed coals explode to damage nearby enemies. It benefits from Damage and Fire Rate upgrades and lantern proximity bonuses. Build it from the placement toolbar or with L3 / left-stick click. Runs using Ember Pot are saved locally and cannot be published to the leaderboard.

### Fixed

- Upgrade comparisons use "to" instead of an arrow symbol that can be missing in web fonts.

## [0.0.21] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- The placement screen now shows each turret's base damage, range and firing interval, plus targeting or slowing effects, below its purchase button. Whole-number stats omit unnecessary decimals.
- Added the Watchlight sniper: long-range shots at the furthest enemy, a directional shuttered housing, and heavy damage with a slow recharge. Build it with right-stick click on a controller or the placement toolbar; damage upgrades and lantern proximity boosts apply.

### Changed

- Basic, Slow, and Watchlight turrets now share the same purchase price: 60 energy initially, increasing by 25 for each purchased turret in the layout.
- Upgrade purchases use mouse clicks or menu navigation and confirmation. Removed the G, F, and H shortcuts and their button hints.
- Watchlights now acquire their next target immediately after shooting and turn toward it during reload, updating their aim as enemies move or die.
- Turret purchases use the mouse toolbar or controller shortcuts. Removed the B, V, and N keyboard purchase shortcuts; right-stick click now selects the Watchlight on controllers.

## [0.0.20] - 2026-09-07

- No player-facing changes recorded for this release.

## [0.0.19] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Early-run Kindling and Flare pickups reward movement with eight seconds of doubled passive energy or a nearby burst of damage. Walk into their marked circles before the countdown expires.
- Pickup markers are compact, with a detailed explanation only on the first offer of each type per run. Flare bursts reach 180 pixels and deal 8 damage.

## [0.0.17] - 2026-09-07

## [0.0.16] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- Release notes now use this maintained changelog instead of commit titles.
- Energy Gain now also boosts the five-minute boss reward: 300 energy without upgrades, increasing by 75 per level to 675 at maximum level.
