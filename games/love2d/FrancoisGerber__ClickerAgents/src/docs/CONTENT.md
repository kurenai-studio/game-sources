# Content — v1

Small on purpose. Twelve agents, twelve skills, ten tools, ten daemons, ten achievements.
Every number here is data,
not code: the game loads these from tables so content can be tuned without touching the loop.

## Agents

You are the framework; agents are what it deploys. Cost is the level-1 price; the next
level is `floor(cost × 1.07^level)`. Damage is throughput at level 1, and the milestone
rule (`×4` at level 25 and every 25 levels after) applies to every agent.

| # | Agent | Base cost | Base DPS | Deploys at | Specialism |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Spider | 6 | 6 | zone 1 | crawler: finds the surface |
| 2 | Pick | 107 | 107 | zone 1 | credential spray, first real throughput |
| 3 | Bait | 700 | 700 | zone 1 | social engineering, converts people into access |
| 4 | Splice | 2,100 | 2,100 | zone 1 | injection: RCE, SQLi, deserialisation |
| 5 | Relay | 4,900 | 4,900 | zone 1 | pivots; stronger the deeper you already are |
| 6 | Grind | 20,500 | 20,500 | zone 1 | hash cracking, works while you are away |
| 7 | Cicada | 95,000 | 95,000 | zone 26 | droppers and persistence on endpoints |
| 8 | Mule | 200,000 | 200,000 | zone 34 | exfiltration and staging |
| 9 | Taint | 1M | 1M | zone 43 | supply chain: one dependency, everything downstream |
| 10 | Hush | 5M | 5M | zone 53 | wireless and implants, walks past a perimeter |
| 11 | Badge | 25M | 25M | zone 64 | insider: buys a human instead of a hole |
| 12 | Onyx | 125M | 125M | zone 76 | endgame framework, multiplies every other agent |

Base throughput equals the base price: one DPS per credit at level 1. That ratio is
what keeps the ladder in front of vuln HP, which grows 55% per zone early and
14.5% past 140.

Each agent costs roughly 4–6× the previous one and deals about 4× its throughput, so a new
agent is always worth more than levelling the last one — that is the whole point of the
7%-cost / 5.7%-damage gap.

## Systems and zones

Each run is one **system**. Ascending consumes it and opens the next, harder target.

| # | System | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Vantel Systems | mid-market SaaS, sloppy, the tutorial target |
| 2 | Brindle & Roe | boutique law firm: secrets, small attack surface |
| 3 | Meridian Freight | logistics: OT networks and tracking telemetry |
| 4 | Corvid Analytics | data broker; the DATA zone is the whole point |
| 5 | Halcyon Diagnostics | hospital group: legacy endpoints, patient records |
| 6 | Kestrel Mutual | insurer: identity fortress, weak suppliers |
| 7 | Vehicle Registry | government, ancient CORE, huge volume |
| 8 | Calder Power | grid operator: air gap and physical security |
| 9 | Civil Infrastructure | ministry; nation-scale and defended |
| 10 | Ostmark Bureau | signals; the endgame, and it hunts back |

Beyond ten, the ladder repeats with a lap number (`VANTEL SYSTEMS 2`).

Within a system every run walks the same six zones:

| Zones | Name | Vulns |
|---|---|---|
| 1–20 | **EDGE** | open port, default creds, exposed API key, stale TLS |
| 21–40 | **IDENTITY** | orphaned account, weak MFA, shared password |
| 41–60 | **NETWORK** | trusted subnet, DNS cache poison, open relay |
| 61–80 | **ENDPOINT** | unpatched build server, signed driver load, CI runner shell |
| 81–99 | **DATA** | public bucket, plain backup, SQL injection |
| 100+ | **CORE** | domain trust, ROOT CA misuse, kernel module |

Each system skews its composition: identity-heavy for banks and insurers, endpoint-heavy
for hospitals, air-gapped CORE for utilities and ministries.

## Boss firewalls

Every fifth zone. One target, **30 seconds**, `10 × H(L)` HP. Failing closes the perimeter:
you lose the attempt, not your credits.

Names cycle per zone: `WAF RULESET`, `MFA GATE`, `SOC TRIAGE`, `EDR FLEET`, `AIR GAP`,
`FORENSICS SWEEP`.

## Tooling

Ten global tools, each bought once at a fixed credit price. They are where credits go when
levelling the best agent is no longer efficient.

| Tool | Cost | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Scanner | 500 | +25% probe damage |
| Wordlist | 2,500 | +10% all throughput |
| Skimmer | 10,000 | +25% credits from vulns |
| Exploit Kit | 50,000 | ×2 probe damage |
| Botnet | 250,000 | +15% all throughput |
| Launderer | 1M | +50% credits from vulns |
| 0-Day | 5M | ×3 probe damage |
| Backdoor | 25M | +20% all throughput |
| Mixer | 125M | +100% credits from vulns |
| Persistence | 1B | +25% throughput, and +1 rootkit per ascension |

## Rootkits

Boss firewalls on zones divisible by 5 and ≥ 100 pay
`floor(((n + 4) / 5) ^ 1.3)` with `n = (zone − 100) / 5` — zone 100 pays 1, zone 150 pays
20, zone 250 pays 137, zone 500 pays 1,306. Plus `floor(totalAgentLevels / 2000)`.

Unspent rootkits are +10% throughput each, permanently, across every system.

First ascension should land at zone 130–150 (the gate is 100, then 200, 400, 800) with roughly 8–15 rootkits: enough that the
bonus is felt immediately, small enough that the second system is clearly better rather
than trivial.

## Skills

Twelve actives, one per agent, each bought with credits on the SKILLS tab. Nothing is
granted on a new save: a fresh run owns no skills until you buy one.
Bought and cast on the SKILLS tab: **A** buys, **X** fires. A cast starts a 30 second
buff and its own cooldown; the row shows `ACTIVE nS` while the buff runs and the
cooldown seconds afterwards, and X is refused until it clears. A crit is x10, per the
design; Phish is what turns every probe into one.

| Skill | Agent | Cost | Cooldown | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Crawl | Spider | 1,000 | 30s | +10 probes/s for 30s |
| Spray | Pick | 12,500 | 45s | ×2 throughput for 30s |
| Phish | Bait | 125,000 | 60s | every probe crits (×10), 30s |
| Splice | Splice | 375,000 | 60s | ×3 probe damage for 30s |
| Flood | Relay | 1M | 90s | ×1.5 throughput for 30s |
| Grind | Grind | 5M | 90s | ×1.5 credits for 30s |
| Cicada | Cicada | 12.5M | 120s | +25 probes/s for 30s |
| Siphon | Mule | 25M | 120s | ×3 credits for 30s |
| Taint | Taint | 75M | 150s | −20% vuln HP for 30s |
| Hush | Hush | 200M | 180s | ×2 probe damage for 30s |
| Badge | Badge | 500M | 180s | ×3 throughput for 30s |
| Blackout | Onyx | 1B | 240s | −30% vuln HP for 30s |

## Achievements

Ten, checked against run state. They exist to give the Stats and Achievements screens
something real to show, and to mark the milestones the design already tunes around.

| Achievement | Requirement |
|---|---|
| First Breach | clear zone 1 |
| Firewall Down | beat 10 boss firewalls |
| Ten Rootkits | hold 10 rootkits at once |
| New Target | ascend for the first time |
| Core Access | reach zone 100 |
| Full Roster | deploy all 12 agents |
| Silent Run | clear 100 vulns |
| Root | reach zone 250 |
| Full Armoury | own all ten tools |
| Every Script | own all twelve skills |

## Out of scope for v1

Rootkit spend beyond the ten systems, gilds, relics, mercenaries, clans,
  auto-probes as purchases, daily quests,
and a second framework. Each is a screen or a timer; none is needed for the loop to be good.

## Tools

Ten one-shot global purchases from the UPGRADES tab (A buys, one each). Prices are in
credits, and the effect is applied the moment the purchase lands.

| Tool | Price | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| SCANNER | 500 | +25% probe damage |
| WORDLIST | 2.5K | +10% throughput |
| SKIMMER | 10K | +25% credits from vulns |
| EXPLOIT KIT | 50K | x2 probe damage |
| BOTNET | 250K | +15% throughput |
| LAUNDERER | 1M | +50% credits from vulns |
| 0-DAY | 5M | x3 probe damage |
| BACKDOOR | 25M | +20% throughput |
| MIXER | 125M | +100% credits from vulns |
| PERSISTENCE | 1B | +25% throughput, +1 rootkit per ascension |

Skills are bought the same way on the SKILLS tab (A buys, X casts); their prices are
1K, 12.5K, 125K, 375K, 1M, 5M, 12.5M, 25M, 75M, 200M, 500M and 1B in roster order.

## Daemons

Rootkit spend on the PRESTIGE tab. Permanent, survive every ascension.

Ten of them, priced so each one costs more than the last.

| Daemon | Rootkits | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| CRON | 5 | +1 probe per second, forever |
| WATCHDOG | 12 | +15% credits from vulns |
| BEACON | 20 | +10% throughput |
| WRAITH | 30 | +15% probe damage |
| HONEYPOT | 45 | +10s on every firewall clock |
| GRID | 75 | +25% credits from vulns |
| SQUID | 110 | +1 rootkit on every ascension |
| TUNNEL | 160 | +3 probes per second |
| LEGION | 240 | +25% throughput |
| SENTRY | 340 | +2h of offline progress replayed |
