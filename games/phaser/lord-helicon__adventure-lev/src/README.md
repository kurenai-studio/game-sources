# Adventure Lev

Adventure Lev is a retro-inspired 2D platformer built with Phaser and Vite. The current game is a short four-level campaign with generated pixel-art assets, procedural audio, and a full menu-to-completion loop.

The live build is deployed to GitHub Pages automatically on every push to `main`.

## Current Scope

- Four campaign levels with escalating layout complexity
- Local save-backed continue flow and best-score tracking
- Tight platforming movement with coyote time and jump buffering
- Coins, checkpoints, power-ups, springs, breakable blocks, and moving platforms
- Ground, flying, hopper, and swooper enemies with stomp interactions
- Final boss encounter that unlocks the last goal in the finale level
- Hidden secret routes in later levels with discovery bonuses
- Touch gameplay controls and tap-friendly menu/overlay navigation
- Persisted alternate keyboard layouts: `Arrows`, `WASD`, and `ZQSD`
- Shared audio manager with browser resume handling for mobile/Safari-style unlock rules
- Runtime cleanup for lower-powered devices: capped particles and reduced per-frame allocations
- Menu, pause, level-complete, and game-over flow
- Persisted audio settings for mute and volume
- Dedicated between-level summary screen and settings overlay
- Runtime-generated art and Web Audio sound/music
