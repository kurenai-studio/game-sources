## Makes numbered, daily and relaxed levels (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md 4.4, GDD 6.3 to 6.6). The same
## kind, number, band and version give the same level on every phone and PC: every choice comes
## from a RandomNumberGenerator seeded by Seeds, lists are walked in a fixed order, and every
## budget is a count. Safe on a worker thread once LevelCatalog.load_all() has run.
##
## Steps for one level:
## 1. Plan: the tier (the sawtooth, the daily tier, or a seeded pick in a Relaxed band), its
##    tray and least peak tray load (GDD 6.8), and the blueprint (G7, a pure function of kind,
##    number and version: see blueprint_for).
## 2. Up to VARIATIONS varied boards (mirrored, shifted, two layers swapped, a plank dropped),
##    each checked against the blueprint rules (G2) and the tier's screws and layers (G1).
## 3. Up to COLORINGS colorings per board, colored with intent (see _color). The novice plays
##    each one first (G4, and G9a where the tier requires it); one that passes is searched with
##    the tier's MAX_STATES and with the top of its tray use range as the cap (the range widened
##    for its peak, see spec_for). A coloring is kept if the search completes, G1 to G6 hold,
##    G10 holds (peak_holds, right after the search) and G9 where the tier requires it.
##    Between tries the coloring pressure goes up when a level came out too easy (or its peak
##    too low) and down when it came out too hard; a G9 failure leaves it alone (GDD 6.4.1).
## 4. If no try is kept after MAX_ATTEMPTS tries or LEVEL_STATES states in all (G9_BUDGET times
##    as many on a tier that requires G9 or a peak), a stored fallback level for the tier
##    (exempt from G7; see _fall_back).
##
## Every number here counts toward GENERATOR_VERSION: changing one changes levels.

## numbered and Relaxed levels have far fewer on their pool's 8. If all were taken it would use
## the first in the order (tests check this never happens with the shipped pools). memo keeps
## the picks made within one call, by stream position.
