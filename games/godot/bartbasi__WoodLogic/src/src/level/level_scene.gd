## The level screen (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md 6 and 10.1): draws the board from the logic model,
## takes touches, and animates what the logic decided. It never decides a rule. A tap goes to
## PlayState at once; the events that come back are animated, and a quick player can tap again
## while the last screw is still flying. If the view and the model disagree, the model is right
## and the view is the bug: reconcile() puts the view right and counts the times it had to.
##
## The helpers (Undo, Extra slot, Screwdriver), the timer and pips, the star bank and the coffee
## cup are here (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md 6 and 11.3). The views are src/render's, made and talked to
## through LevelViews. Pause, Out of room, Level clear and the helper sheets are the app flow's
## screens.
