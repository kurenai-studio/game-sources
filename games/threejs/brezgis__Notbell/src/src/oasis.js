// Oasis Estates — A Planned Community. South-west, out past the chart's
// western edge, on an island that didn't happen so much as get approved: a
// flat oval of lawn mown in stripes, seven identical houses around a
// cul-de-sac, a strip of shops, a coffee place, a chicken place that is not
// chicken, and the CaMall. Camels, parrots, one brontosaurus family. Beverly
// Humphries is the president of the Homeowners' Association. Do not mess
// with Beverly.
//
// One ferry: the HOA approved exactly one route, to BULKO and back (bulk
// goods are consistent with the character of the community). A rowboat can
// also land on the east beach; the HOA has not yet noticed rowboats.
//
// Bell hook (do not resolve): the covenant forbids bells — doorbells, bike
// bells, wind chimes, the ice cream truck's song. Nobody knows why. The
// developer wrote it in: Moledecai Developments. Trader Polly's rings no bell
// at the till; Pico says "BRRRING" out loud instead.
//
// Layout is in pad-local (u, v): u east, v south, from the pad's center.
// The camera looks north, so everything that can faces south (+v).
