# Building and running

## Requirements

- [.NET SDK 10](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or newer
- Optionally an IDE: Visual Studio 2022 (17.13+) / 2026, JetBrains Rider or VS Code with C# Dev Kit

Packages (MonoGame 3.8 DesktopGL, Aether.Physics2D 2.2) are restored
automatically from NuGet. Their versions are managed centrally in
`Directory.Packages.props`. The build also restores the content pipeline tool
(`dotnet-mgcb`, listed in `.config/dotnet-tools.json`) and builds the models with it.

## Desktop

```sh
dotnet build TW3D.slnx

# game
dotnet run --project src/TW3D.Game
dotnet run --project src/TW3D.Game -- --windowed --level lock

# level editor (the game with the editor screen)
dotnet run --project src/TW3D.Game -- --editor lock
```

Game arguments for development:

| Argument | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--windowed` | 1280×720 window instead of full screen |
| `--size WxH` | Window of the given size, e.g. `--size 2560x1080` for testing other aspect ratios (the window can also be resized) |
| `--level <name>` | Skips the menu and loads the level directly (the file name in `content/Levels` without `.json`, e.g. `lock`). Esc returns to the menu. |
| `--tutorial` | Shows the tutorial's lessons of each level again, learnt or not, saving nothing |
| `--tutorial demo` | Shows every lesson of the tutorial in turn on any level, each done by itself after two seconds (for screenshots), saving nothing |
| `--sounds <folder>` | Writes every sound effect as a WAV file into the folder and quits, to listen to them |
| `--editor [<level>]` | Opens the level editor (see [Levels](levels.md#level-editor)) instead of the game, in a window: with a level name of the levels folder (`lock`) or a level file; without one, the level edited last (a new level when there is none) |
| `--levels <folder>` | The levels folder of the editor, where it opens and saves levels, instead of `content/Levels` of the repository (e.g. a scratch folder for trying the editor out) |

The game has been tested on Windows. DesktopGL also supports Linux and macOS, but
the game has not been tested there yet. The level editor is a part of the game and runs
wherever the game runs; the Android build leaves it out.

## Tests and CI

```sh
dotnet test TW3D.slnx
```

`tests/TW3D.Tests` (xUnit) tests what needs no graphics device: the shipped content (every
level fits the catalog, has a finish and a preview and is written as `LevelFile` writes
it; every model of the catalog exists and is built, and the physics has its collision
shape), the score of a run, the rules of the tutorial and the sound effects (each peaks at 0.9,
ends quietly, is heard on small speakers and is not shrill). The files of the game it tests
are compiled into it, as they have no MonoGame in them.

Every push runs `.github/workflows/build.yml` on GitHub Actions: the solution built in
Debug and Release, the tests, a check that the collision shapes and the generated
training levels are what their generators make (`tools/CollisionGen`,
`tools/levelgen/training*.js`), and the Android build.

## Android

`src/TW3D.Android` builds the game for Android phones (Android 7.0 and newer). It
compiles the code of `src/TW3D.Game` (linked, not copied); what differs between the
platforms is marked `#if ANDROID`: full screen in landscape, a twice as big user
interface, 4× multisampling, the level list read from the app and the highest
refresh rate of the display. The project is not in `TW3D.slnx`, so the desktop build
needs no Android tools.

Once, the Android workload, the Android SDK and JDK 17 (the SDK in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk` is found automatically, the JDK has to be given):

```sh
dotnet workload install android
dotnet build src/TW3D.Android -t:InstallAndroidDependencies -f net10.0-android -p:AndroidSdkDirectory=<SDK folder> -p:JavaSdkDirectory=<JDK folder> -p:AcceptAndroidSDKLicenses=True
```

Installing on a phone connected by USB with USB debugging enabled:

```sh
dotnet build src/TW3D.Android -t:Install -p:JavaSdkDirectory=<JDK folder>
```

The debug build installs the code next to the app (fast deployment), so its APK
file alone does not run. A standalone APK comes from the release build, with the
code compiled ahead of time for arm64 (phones) and x86_64:

```sh
dotnet publish src/TW3D.Android -c Release -p:JavaSdkDirectory=<JDK folder>
```

It writes `src/TW3D.Android/bin/Release/net10.0-android/publish/io.github.antoninprazsky.tw3d-Signed.apk`
(and an `.aab` bundle for Google Play). Copy the APK to a phone and open it there
(the phone asks to allow installing apps from that source), or install it with
`adb install`. It is signed with the Android debug key of the computer that built
it; an app signed with another key (another computer, or a release key for Google
Play) cannot update it, the old one has to be uninstalled first.
