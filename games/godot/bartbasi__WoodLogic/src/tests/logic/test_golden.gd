## The golden test (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md 4.4 and 5.4): a fixed set of levels (numbered 9 to 40,
## a spread of 50 to 160 covering tiers 7 to 10 with a deep opening and fallbacks, three
## dailies, two Relaxed levels per band) must keep their fingerprints (blueprint, board,
## tier, tray par, par time, colors and queue; whole numbers only). A change that alters any of
## them fails here until GENERATOR_VERSION goes up and the file is written again with
## tools/levels/levels.gd -- --golden.
