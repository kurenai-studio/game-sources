# Board and Piece Movement Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** A 400-piece grid-cut puzzle board on which pieces drag with one finger and the camera pinch-zooms and pans, running on the desktop and on the Nothing Phone (4a), with a frame-rate counter.

**Architecture:** A pure-logic cut generator (`src/cut/`) builds a graph of vertices and faces and turns it into pieces. The game layer (`src/game/`) draws each piece as a `Polygon2D` whose texture coordinates are its outline, keeps the board and pieces in one world, and moves a `Camera2D` through small pure helpers that are unit tested. Positions: outlines are in image coordinates, and a piece node's `position` is its displacement from home, so a solved piece has `position == Vector2.ZERO`.

**Tech Stack:** Godot 4.7.2, GDScript, Mobile renderer. Tests are plain headless scripts.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-22-board-and-piece-movement-design.md`. Also read `INTENT.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Global Constraints

- Godot 4.7.2, GDScript, Mobile renderer. Android Min SDK is 29 with this renderer.
- Package name `io.github.aaryash_shakya.pieceful`. Do not change it.
- Layout: generator in `src/cut/`, board, camera and input in `src/game/`, UI in `src/ui/`, tests in `tests/`.
- Generation is deterministic. Use the project's own `SeededRng`, never the engine's global random. Round generated points to a fixed precision.
- The generator exposes `generate_cut(width, height, target_count, style, seed)` and has no dependency on scenes or nodes.
- Every style produces a graph of vertices and shared edges, with pieces as the faces between them. No separate pipeline per style.
- Never store piece geometry. Only image, style, count and seed identify a cut.
- Pieces are drawn with `Polygon2D`. Hit-testing uses `Geometry2D.is_point_in_polygon`. Pieces never rotate.
- Piece outline: dark, about 2.3 px wide, 80% opacity. Palette values come from `docs/visual-design.md`.
- 400 pieces must hold 60 fps while dragging and while pinch-zooming and panning on the Nothing Phone (4a). Record the refresh rate for each check.
- No new dependencies, analytics or network calls. Match the style of the surrounding code and keep comments sparse.
- Commit after each task using conventional commit messages.

## Review Focus

- Generator with `target_count` 1, a count larger than the pixel grid allows, or an extreme shape such as 10000 by 100: still valid pieces, no zero-area piece (Task 2).
- A second finger lands while a piece is being dragged: the piece stays held under the first finger and the second finger pans and zooms the view, the drag continues when it lifts, the piece is dropped if the holding finger lifts first, nothing is stuck held, no jump (Task 7).
- One finger lifts during a pinch: the remaining finger must not pan or jump the camera until all fingers are up (Task 7).
- Panning or zooming far beyond the loose area: the camera clamps and the board can never be lost (Tasks 4 and 7).
- A cancelled touch (a system gesture or notification during a drag) is treated as a release and leaves no piece held (Task 7).

### Task 1: Test harness and seeded random generator

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/base_test.gd`, `tests/test_seeded_rng.gd`, `src/cut/seeded_rng.gd`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `BaseTest extends SceneTree` with `check(condition: bool, message: String) -> void` and `finish() -> void` (prints the failure count, calls `quit(1)` if any failed, else `quit(0)`). Every later test extends it and calls `finish()` at the end of `_init()`.
- Produces: `SeededRng extends RefCounted` with `_init(seed_value: int)`, `next_u32() -> int`, `next_float() -> float` (in [0, 1)), `range_float(from: float, to: float) -> float`, `range_int(from: int, to_inclusive: int) -> int`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `tests/base_test.gd` and the failing test `tests/test_seeded_rng.gd`.** Assertions: `SeededRng.new(1).next_u32() == 270369`; two `SeededRng.new(42)` produce the same first 5 `next_u32()` values; 1000 draws of `SeededRng.new(7).next_float()` are all `>= 0.0` and `< 1.0`; `range_int(3, 5)` over 1000 draws only returns 3, 4 or 5 and returns all three.
- [ ] **Step 2: Build the class cache and run the test, expecting failure.** Run: `godot --headless --import` then `godot --headless --script tests/test_seeded_rng.gd`. Expected: errors about `SeededRng` not found. Repeat the `--import` whenever a file with a new `class_name` is added.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement `SeededRng`.** Use xorshift32 (shifts 13, 17, 5) with the state masked to 32 bits after every step, because GDScript ints are signed 64-bit. A seed of 0 becomes 1. `next_float()` is `next_u32() / 4294967296.0`.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run again.** Expected: `0 failure(s)`, exit code 0.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.** `git add tests src/cut && git commit -m "test: add headless test harness and seeded random generator"`

### Task 2: Cut generator, grid style

**Files:**
- Create: `src/cut/cut_piece.gd`, `src/cut/cut_graph.gd`, `src/cut/cut_generator.gd`, `tests/test_cut_generator.gd`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing (the grid style needs no randomness yet).
- Produces: `CutPiece extends RefCounted` with `id: int` (index in the returned array), `outline: PackedVector2Array` (closed implicitly, image coordinates), `home: Vector2` (centre of the outline's bounding rectangle), `neighbours: PackedInt32Array`, `area() -> float` (shoelace), `bounds() -> Rect2`.
- Produces: `CutGraph extends RefCounted` with `vertices: PackedVector2Array`, `faces: Array[PackedInt32Array]` (vertex indices, the same winding for every face so a shared edge is traversed in opposite directions), `edge_use_counts() -> Dictionary` (key `Vector2i(min_index, max_index)`, value how many faces use that edge).
- Produces: `CutGenerator` with `const STYLE_GRID := "grid"`, `static grid_split(width: int, height: int, target_count: int) -> Vector2i` (x = columns, y = rows), `static build_grid_graph(width: int, height: int, columns: int, rows: int) -> CutGraph`, `static generate_cut(width: int, height: int, target_count: int, style: String, seed: int) -> Array[CutPiece]`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test `tests/test_cut_generator.gd`.** A helper `check_cut(pieces, w, h, count_hint)` asserts: summed `area()` equals `w * h`; every piece's area is at least half of `w * h / pieces.size()`; neighbour lists are symmetric and never contain the piece itself; in the graph for the same split every edge count is 1 or 2, and the number of edges with count 1 equals `2 * (columns + rows)`. Run it for counts 1, 12, 54, 150 and 400 at 1536 by 1024. Also assert: `grid_split(1500, 1000, 54) == Vector2i(9, 6)` and `grid_split(1500, 1000, 150) == Vector2i(15, 10)`; for 400 at 1536 by 1024 the product is within 40 of 400 and the cell aspect ratio is between 0.8 and 1.25; `generate_cut(10000, 100, 50, "grid", 1)` passes `check_cut`; two calls with the same inputs give equal outlines and neighbours; an unknown style, a width of 0 and a `target_count` of 0 each return an empty array.
- [ ] **Step 2: Run it.** `godot --headless --import` then `godot --headless --script tests/test_cut_generator.gd`. Expected: FAIL, classes not found.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the three classes.** Grid boundaries are integers (`roundi(i * width / float(columns))`) so areas sum exactly. `grid_split` picks the rows and columns whose product is closest to `target_count` among splits with near-square cells. `generate_cut` is `grid_split` then `build_grid_graph` then a conversion of faces to pieces, with neighbours found from edges shared between two faces. Round every point to 3 decimals with `snappedf`. For invalid input call `push_error` and return an empty array. The `seed` parameter name follows `AGENTS.md`. Rename it if the shadowing warning is treated as an error.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run again.** Expected: `0 failure(s)`.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.** `git add src/cut tests && git commit -m "feat: add grid cut generator with graph of shared edges"`

### Task 3: Scatter

**Files:**
- Create: `src/game/scatter.gd`, `tests/test_scatter.gd`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `CutPiece.bounds()`, `SeededRng`.
- Produces: `Scatter.scatter(pieces: Array[CutPiece], image_size: Vector2, margin: float, seed: int) -> PackedVector2Array`, one displacement per piece in array order, to be used as the piece node's `position`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test.** With 400 pieces from `generate_cut(1536, 1024, 400, "grid", 1)`, `image_size` (1536, 1024), margin 768: result size equals piece count; for each piece, its bounds moved by its displacement do not intersect `Rect2(0, 0, 1536, 1024)` and are enclosed by that rect grown by 768; the same seed twice gives equal results; seeds 1 and 2 differ.
- [ ] **Step 2: Run it, expecting failure.** `godot --headless --import`, then `godot --headless --script tests/test_scatter.gd`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement `Scatter.scatter`.** Pieces may overlap each other. Use a `SeededRng` for positions. The algorithm is the builder's choice, for example random points in the outer rectangle with rejection of those that overlap the board.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run again.** Expected: `0 failure(s)`.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.** `git add src/game tests && git commit -m "feat: add deterministic scatter of loose pieces around the board"`

### Task 4: Camera helpers

**Files:**
- Create: `src/game/camera_rig.gd`, `tests/test_camera_rig.gd`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `CameraRig` with `const MIN_ZOOM := 0.15`, `const MAX_ZOOM := 3.0`, `static clamp_zoom(zoom: float) -> float`, `static clamp_position(position: Vector2, bounds: Rect2) -> Vector2`, `static zoom_about(camera_position: Vector2, old_zoom: float, new_zoom: float, anchor_offset: Vector2) -> Vector2` (returns the new camera position that keeps the world point under the anchor fixed, where `anchor_offset` is the anchor's screen position minus the viewport centre), `static edge_pan_velocity(screen_position: Vector2, viewport_size: Vector2, margin: float, max_speed: float) -> Vector2` (screen pixels per second, pointing toward the edge being approached, zero beyond `margin` from every edge, `max_speed` at the edge, linear in between).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test.** `zoom_about(Vector2(100, 50), 1.0, 2.0, Vector2(40, 20)) == Vector2(120, 60)`; `clamp_zoom(0.01) == CameraRig.MIN_ZOOM` and `clamp_zoom(99.0) == CameraRig.MAX_ZOOM`; `clamp_position(Vector2(500, -500), Rect2(-100, -100, 200, 200)) == Vector2(100, -100)`; for a 540 by 1200 viewport, margin 48, max speed 600: `edge_pan_velocity(Vector2(5, 600), ...)` has x close to -537.5 and y 0, `Vector2(270, 600)` gives `Vector2.ZERO`, and `Vector2(535, 1195)` has both components positive.
- [ ] **Step 2: Run it, expecting failure.** `godot --headless --import`, then `godot --headless --script tests/test_camera_rig.gd`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the four static functions.** The zoom formula is `camera_position + anchor_offset * (1.0 / old_zoom - 1.0 / new_zoom)`.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run again.** Expected: `0 failure(s)`.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.** `git add src/game tests && git commit -m "feat: add camera zoom, clamp and edge-pan helpers"`

### Task 5: Piece node

**Files:**
- Create: `src/game/piece_node.gd`, `tests/test_piece_node.gd`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `CutPiece`.
- Produces: `PieceNode extends Node2D` with `piece_id: int`, `setup(piece: CutPiece, texture: Texture2D, outline_color: Color) -> void`, `contains_point(world_point: Vector2) -> bool`, `set_held(held: bool) -> void`. Children: a `Polygon2D` with `polygon` and `uv` both set to the outline and the full image as texture, a closed `Line2D` outline 2.3 world units wide and antialiased, and a hidden shadow `Polygon2D` (black at about 35% opacity, offset a few units down and right) shown only while held.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test.** Build a `CutPiece` with the square outline (0,0), (10,0), (10,10), (0,10), create a `PieceNode`, call `setup(piece, GradientTexture2D.new(), Color.BLACK)`, add it with `root.add_child` (`to_local` needs the node in the tree), set `position = Vector2(100, 0)`. Assert `contains_point(Vector2(105, 5))` is true and `contains_point(Vector2(5, 5))` is false, and `set_held(true)` then `set_held(false)` runs without error.
- [ ] **Step 2: Run it, expecting failure.** `godot --headless --import`, then `godot --headless --script tests/test_piece_node.gd`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement `PieceNode`.** `contains_point` uses `Geometry2D.is_point_in_polygon(to_local(world_point), outline)`.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run again.** Expected: `0 failure(s)`.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.** `git add src/game tests && git commit -m "feat: add piece node with outline, shadow and hit test"`

### Task 6: Board scene with palette and scattered pieces

**Files:**
- Create: `src/game/palette.gd`, `src/game/board.gd`, `src/game/board.tscn`, `tests/test_palette.gd`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `CutGenerator.generate_cut`, `Scatter.scatter`, `PieceNode`.
- Produces: `Palette` with `static is_dark() -> bool` (false when `DisplayServer.is_dark_mode_supported()` is false), and `static felt(dark := is_dark()) -> Color`, `board(dark := is_dark())`, `accent(dark := is_dark())`, `outline() -> Color` (dark tone at 80% alpha). Values: felt light `#223a63`, dark `#14264a`; board light `#2c4878`, dark `#1c3463`; accent light `#e2a41f`, dark `#ffc857`.
- Produces: `Board extends Node2D` with constants `IMAGE_SIZE := Vector2i(1536, 1024)`, `PIECE_COUNT := 400`, `SEED := 1`, `LOOSE_MARGIN := 768.0`; children `Camera` (`Camera2D`) and `Pieces` (`Node2D` holding one `PieceNode` per piece, in id order). The board rectangle is `Rect2(Vector2.ZERO, IMAGE_SIZE)`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test `tests/test_palette.gd`.** Assert the six colour values above with `Color.html` equality for both modes.
- [ ] **Step 2: Run it, expecting failure.** `godot --headless --import`, then `godot --headless --script tests/test_palette.gd`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement `Palette`.** Run the test and expect `0 failure(s)`.
- [ ] **Step 4: Implement `Board` and `board.tscn`.** The texture is a `GradientTexture2D` sized `IMAGE_SIZE` with a diagonal rainbow gradient, which needs no image file. The scene sets the clear colour to `Palette.felt()`, draws the board rectangle in `Palette.board()` with a thin outline, calls `generate_cut`, creates one `PieceNode` per piece, applies `Scatter.scatter` displacements as positions, and centres the camera on the board at a zoom that fits the board width with a small border. This is also the board for Task 7.
- [ ] **Step 5: Run the scene on the desktop.** Run: `godot --path . res://src/game/board.tscn` (or F6 in the editor). Expected: navy felt, the board rectangle, 400 pieces scattered around it, no errors in the Output panel.
- [ ] **Step 6: Commit.** `git add src tests && git commit -m "feat: add board scene with palette and scattered pieces"`

### Task 7: Input and camera control

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/game/board.gd`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `CameraRig`, `PieceNode.contains_point`, `PieceNode.set_held`, `Palette`.
- Produces: no new public API. Behaviour is the state machine below. Handle `InputEventScreenTouch` and `InputEventScreenDrag` only, so `emulate_touch_from_mouse` (Task 8) covers the desktop. Also zoom on the mouse wheel as a desktop stand-in for pinch.

State machine, tracked per touch index:

| State | Event | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Idle | first touch down on a piece (topmost hit, iterate `Pieces` children in reverse) | Dragging: move the piece to the last child, `set_held(true)` |
| Idle | first touch down on empty space | Panning |
| Dragging | second touch down | Hold-pinching: the piece stays held under the first finger and the second finger pans and zooms the view; when the second finger lifts the drag continues, and if the holding finger lifts first the piece is dropped in place |
| Panning | second touch down | Pinching |
| Dragging | drag | `piece.position += relative / camera.zoom.x` |
| Panning | drag | camera position `-= relative / camera.zoom.x`, clamped |
| Pinching | drag | zoom by the ratio of finger distance to previous distance, about the midpoint, clamped |
| any | touch up for the last finger, or `canceled` | Idle, `set_held(false)` |
| Pinching | one finger up, one left | stay Pinching-ended (no pan, no jump) until every finger is up |

While Dragging, each `_process` frame moves the camera by `CameraRig.edge_pan_velocity(...)` converted to world units (divide by zoom) with margin 48 and max speed 600 screen pixels per second, then clamps it. Camera bounds are the board rectangle grown by `LOOSE_MARGIN`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Implement the state machine in `board.gd`.**
- [ ] **Step 2: Check on the desktop with `godot --path . res://src/game/board.tscn`.** Expected: dragging a piece with the mouse moves it and keeps it on top after release; dragging empty space pans; the wheel zooms about the cursor so the point under it stays fixed; zooming and panning far out stops at the limits and the board stays reachable; dragging a piece close to the window edge pans the camera; no errors in Output.
- [ ] **Step 3: Check the touch cases on the phone in Task 9.** Pin these there: a second finger landing during a drag keeps the piece held under the first finger and pans and zooms the view, the drag continues when it lifts, and the piece is dropped if the holding finger lifts first; lifting one finger of a pinch does not pan or jump the camera; a notification pulled down mid-drag does not leave a piece lifted.
- [ ] **Step 4: Commit.** `git add src/game && git commit -m "feat: add piece dragging, pan, pinch zoom and edge pan"`

### Task 8: Frame-rate counter and project settings

**Files:**
- Create: `src/ui/fps_counter.gd`, `src/ui/fps_counter.tscn`
- Modify: `src/game/board.tscn` (add the counter), `project.godot`
- Delete: `test.tscn`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Palette.accent()`.
- Produces: `FpsCounter extends CanvasLayer` showing `"<fps> fps  <hz> Hz"` from `Engine.get_frames_per_second()` and `DisplayServer.screen_get_refresh_rate()`, in the accent colour at a screen corner clear of the status bar, and calling `queue_free()` in `_ready` unless `OS.is_debug_build()`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Implement the counter and add it to `board.tscn`.**
- [ ] **Step 2: Set the project settings.** Main scene `res://src/game/board.tscn` (replacing the test scene's entry), portrait orientation (`display/window/handheld/orientation`), viewport 540 by 1200 (`display/window/size/viewport_width` and `viewport_height`), and `input_devices/pointing/emulate_touch_from_mouse=true`. Leave the Android pan-and-scale gesture setting off, since touches are handled raw.
- [ ] **Step 3: Delete `test.tscn`** (the throwaway scene from the setup run, never committed, so there is nothing to stage for it).
- [ ] **Step 4: Run `godot --path .`.** Expected: the board opens as the main scene in a portrait window with the counter showing a frame rate, and the Task 7 desktop checks still pass.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.** `git add src project.godot && git commit -m "feat: add frame-rate counter and project settings"`

### Task 9: Run on the phone and record results

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/engine-decision.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Deploy.** Unlock the Nothing Phone (4a), then click Remote Deploy and Play. Expected: the board opens in portrait with the counter visible.
- [ ] **Step 2: Measure at 400 pieces and write down the numbers.** At the starting zoom only about 140 of the 400 pieces are on screen, so zoom out to the minimum first, with all 400 pieces visible (at `MIN_ZOOM` the view covers the whole loose area). Then drag a piece continuously for 10 seconds, and pinch-zoom and pan continuously for 10 seconds. Note the lowest frame rate, the worst frame time shown by the counter, and the refresh rate for each. Repeat the drag check once at the starting zoom.
- [ ] **Step 3: Check the edge and touch cases.** Edges look clean (if jagged, try 2D MSAA in Project Settings, Rendering, Anti Aliasing, and note the effect on frame rate); pinch and pan work reliably; the three touch cases from Task 7 Step 3 behave as described.
- [ ] **Step 4: Record the results** in a new "Board and piece movement results" section of `docs/engine-decision.md`: date, device, refresh rate, the lowest fps for each check, and whether the edges and gestures passed.
- [ ] **Step 5: If any frame-rate check is below 60, stop and report to the owner.** Switching to pre-baked sprites or reopening the engine choice changes an architecture rule, so it needs their decision.
- [ ] **Step 6: Commit.** `git add docs && git commit -m "docs: record board and piece movement results on the Nothing Phone (4a)"`
