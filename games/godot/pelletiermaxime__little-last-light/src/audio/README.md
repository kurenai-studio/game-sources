`game_audio.gd` owns one AudioStreamPlayer per cue. Shots have a shared 120 ms
cooldown and at most two overlapping voices; damage has a 250 ms cooldown.
Other cues have one voice each. Default sound volume is 50%, applied on top of
the gains above. Settings provides volume cycling (0/25/50/75/100%) and mute;
preferences live separately from progress in `user://audio-settings.cfg`.
Audio uses normal Godot playback without bus effects, including on Web.
The 0.5-second Rainkeeper impact plays once when each warning ends and its pool
appears. It does not loop and follows the same volume, mute, pause, and combat-stop controls.
