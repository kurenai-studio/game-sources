# Next: HUD details (M7.6)

Sources. **ZH src** = ~/projects/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour @ 0a05454, paths under `GeneralsMD/Code/GameEngine/Source/` (headers under `Include/`). **INI** = retail root `INIZH.big` decoded into the session scratchpad, cited as archive entry:line. Already decided, not asked: queue of 9, minimap flash on attack, minimap free with the Command Center and blank at low power or without a radar provider, letter hotkeys on buttons, camera spots F1-F8 with the HUD, "keep formation" considered here, blocker highlight on refused placement (design-answers 2026-11-08). Wargrid today has no sell (`rg -i sell game/scripts/simulation`: nothing) and draws a health bar when a unit is selected or damaged (`game/scripts/presentation/world_view.gd:251-254`).

## Findings (short, cited)
- **source** Every ZH factory and base building has a Sell button (`data\ini\commandset.ini:770` War Factory slot 14 `Command_Sell`). Selling returns 50 % of the cost (`data\ini\gamedata.ini:390`) and takes 3 s while the building "un-builds" (ZH src Common/System/BuildAssistant.cpp:177, 1499-1603).
- **source** Health bars are drawn only for selected objects and the one under the mouse (GameClient/Drawable.cpp:3855-3859; `ShowObjectHealth = Yes`, gamedata.ini:25).
- **source** Veterancy chevrons are drawn above every unit that has a level, with no selection check (Drawable.cpp:2807, 3797-3815). **inferred** enemies' chevrons show too (no relationship check in that function).
- **source** No selection limit in retail: `MaxSelectionSize = 0 ; <1 to disable` (`data\ini\ingameui.ini:7`; InGameUI.cpp:144-150).
- **source** Combat units carry Attack Move, Guard and Stop buttons (commandset.ini:489-491, Crusader). Guard (human-controlled) attacks inside 1.8 x vision and chases to 2.2 x vision for up to 10 s (`data\ini\default\aidata.ini:18-20`). Wargrid has `attack_move` and an idle guard intent already (`simulation.gd:181, 401`), no explicit Guard order.
- **source** Each player may place up to 3 map beacons (pings with text) visible to allies (`data\ini\multiplayer.ini:37`; beacon messages handled in GameLogic/System/GameLogicDispatch.cpp before :1783 "end beacon text").

## Questions
**Answered 2026-11-09:** Q1-Q3 a (sell every building, 50 %, 3 s), Q4 b (selected or damaged, today), Q5 a, Q6 a, Q7 a, Q8 b (pings without text); recorded in the [design answers](../reference/design-answers-2026-11-08.md#hud-m76).

Q1. Should players be able to sell their own buildings?
   a) Yes, every building has a Sell button — ZH default (commandset.ini:770)   b) No selling   c) Only non-production buildings
   Recommendation: a, because selling is a standard ZH escape valve and the HUD is the place for the button. Why it matters: a new command with same-tick cases against attack, capture and production.

Q2. How much money does selling return?
   a) 50 % of the building's cost — ZH default (gamedata.ini:390)   b) 50 % scaled by remaining health   c) 25 %
   Recommendation: a, because it is ZH. Why it matters: decides if selling a damaged building is worth it.

Q3. How long does selling take?
   a) 3 s, during which the building can still be destroyed — ZH default (BuildAssistant.cpp:177)   b) Instant   c) 5 s
   Recommendation: a, because it is ZH and gives attackers a window. Why it matters: needs a "being sold" state that blocks production and repair.

Q4. When should health bars show?
   a) Only for selected units and the one under the mouse — ZH default (Drawable.cpp:3855-3859)   b) Selected or damaged (Wargrid today)   c) Always for everything
   Recommendation: b, because damaged-unit bars help read fights without a mouse-over, and the screen stays calm at full health. Why it matters: the M7.5 art pass draws whichever is chosen.

Q5. Should veterancy chevrons show above every unit, enemies included?
   a) Yes, always, for every side — ZH default (Drawable.cpp:2807, 3797-3815; enemies inferred)   b) Only your own and allied units   c) Only when selected
   Recommendation: a, because seeing enemy veterans is useful information and matches ZH. Why it matters: the bot observation must then include enemy veterancy as public, visible information.

Q6. Is there a limit to how many units one box selection can take?
   a) No limit — ZH retail default (ingameui.ini:7)   b) 40 units   c) 100 units
   Recommendation: a, because ZH has none and 3v3 armies are large. Why it matters: the selection panel must lay out any count.

Q7. Should units get a Guard order (hold an area, attack what comes close, chase a bit, return)?
   a) Yes: attacks inside 1.8 x vision, chases to 2.2 x vision for up to 10 s, then returns — ZH default (aidata.ini:18-20, commandset.ini:490)   b) No, the idle behaviour is enough   c) Yes, but no chase
   Recommendation: a, because it is a standard ZH button next to Attack Move and Stop. Why it matters: a new command with same-tick cases.

Q8. Should players be able to drop map beacons (a ping with a short text) for teammates?
   a) Yes, up to 3 per player — ZH default (multiplayer.ini:37)   b) Pings without text   c) No beacons
   Recommendation: a, because 3v3 with friends needs a way to point at the map. Why it matters: beacons are commands in the lockstep stream (ZH sends them as game messages).

## HUD v2 mock-up review (2026-11-09)
GPT's [HUD v2 mock-up](../images/hud-v2/wargrid-hud-v2.png) ([notes](../images/hud-v2/wargrid-hud-v2-notes.md)) is a proposal, not a decision, and need not be perfect (user). Reviewed by Claude at 1920 x 1080; points to settle in M7.6 planning:
- **Hotkey clash (fixed in the mock-up):** production buttons used `1` and `2`, but `1`-`0` are control groups (blueprint Controls). The SVG and PNG now show a letter grid (`Q`, `W`), as AoE IV and BAR use; the actual letter scheme is still open.
- **Screen coverage:** the bottom dock is about 23 % of the height; with the top bar and the floating alert, team, control-group and tooltip panels roughly a third of the screen is HUD (estimated by eye, not measured). On the Steam Deck (1280 x 800, the budget device) it covers more, or the 11-12 px labels become unreadable. Check at Deck size before choosing a layout.
- **Pinned factory context:** selection panel and a pinned factory panel side by side (produce without deselecting the army); the notes say A/G/S must never go to the pinned factory, fallback is one dock that switches between army and factory. Open choice.
- **Optional panels** (control-group bar, idle army, alert feed, production/upgrade overview, hover tooltip, team strip): each open, keep or drop; see also [hud-modern-recheck.md](hud-modern-recheck.md) once written.
- **Readability at true scale (for the M7.5 art lab, not HUD):** infantry at 12 px read as dots (true size was chosen 2026-11-09); veterancy chevrons and the white unit diamonds are hard to see.
- **Minor:** the teammate ping already uses the pinging ally's colour (Ally 2 pink), but pink next to red enemies reads like enemy red: ally and enemy colours need checking together (the ally/enemy colour option, off by default, would solve it for players who turn it on). "12/10 LOW POWER" reads fine without a power bar.
- **Colours:** the notes propose exact owner colours and a teal UI accent that differ slightly from Claude's mock-up guesses; neither set is decided (art lab).
- **Unchecked:** the three AoE IV / BAR source links in the notes were not fetched. Verified: Medium Tank cost 800 and 300 ticks (`game/scripts/simulation/definitions/china.gd:13`).

## Mock-up questions answered (2026-11-09, click page)
Layout compact (one bottom dock); army and pinned factory panels side by side; production hotkeys by position grid (must avoid A, G, S); large selection as cards per kind; alert feed kept; team strip as a toggle; "Show performance" in a menu. Recorded in the [design answers](../reference/design-answers-2026-11-08.md#hud-m76).

## HUD v3 frames review (2026-11-09)
GPT's [HUD v3 frames](../images/hud-v3/wargrid-hud-v3-notes.md) (Steam Deck, compact, 120-unit selection, placement; proposals, not decisions). HUD coverage as measured by GPT (opaque panel area): compact 18.3 % at 1920 x 1080, Deck 33.9 % at 1280 x 800 (text at least 13 px), large selection 24.1 %, placement 27.5 %; v2 was about a third by eye.
- **Layout:** the compact variant (one bottom dock, minimap inside, optional panels collapsed to toggles) is the strongest candidate; on the Deck the same dock is readable but costs a third of the screen.
- **Large selection:** kind cards with count and aggregate health, click to filter, shift-click to add, pages of 12; a good modern pattern. The world view shows 120 selected health bars as noise, which supports the re-check's health-bar setting or hover-only idea ([hud-modern-recheck.md](hud-modern-recheck.md)).
- **Placement conflict:** the refused example is blocked by an own tank, but own units on a new footprint move to the nearest free cell (friend's playtest answer, [design answers](../reference/design-answers-2026-11-08.md#friends-playtest-reported-by-the-user-2026-11-08)); a refusal example should use an enemy unit or a building. The grid only near the preview fits "grid only while placing".
- **Minor:** the bulldozer shows Attack Move and Guard; builder palette uses Q W E R like production (context-dependent letters, scheme still open).
