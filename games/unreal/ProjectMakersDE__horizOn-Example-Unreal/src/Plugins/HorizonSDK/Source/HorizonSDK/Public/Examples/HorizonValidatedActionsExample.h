/**
 * Minimal example: horizOn Validated Actions (server-checked runs and server-owned state).
 *
 * What it does: connects, signs up anonymously (runs need a signed-in player), reads the
 * player's server-owned values (GetState), starts a run bound to the leaderboard
 * LeaderboardKey with a run start context (versions, content digest, initial state), seeds a
 * random stream with the server seed, records a tiny input log, and
 * submits score plus log hash. With ValueKey set, the run also earns EarnedAmount of that
 * value, and the state after the run is logged (Requested, Credited, EarnedToday / DailyCap).
 * Finally it shows how to mirror the state into the cloud save (log only, unless
 * bMirrorToCloudSave is on). A rejected run logs the code (for example DURATION_TOO_SHORT).
 * When the server asks for the input log (Result.Evidence.bRequired, for example a run in the
 * board's top N, or a sus run), the SDK uploads it by itself and the example logs the evidence
 * events. A sus run (Result.bSus) counts but is kept by the server for a review. With
 * bUploadEvidenceManually the automatic upload is off and the example calls UploadEvidence.
 * A player banned from the board gets PLAYER_BANNED; the run stays and the example discards it.
 *
 * Before running: nothing is required. Without a rule set the server accepts every run with
 * its default rules. To see server-owned values, define a value (for example "gold" with
 * "maxPerRun": 100) under "values" in the Validated Actions rules of your API key in the
 * horizOn Dashboard and set ValueKey to that key. A ValueKey the rules do not define rejects
 * the run with UNKNOWN_VALUE_KEY. To see a rule rejection, set "minDurationSeconds" above a
 * few seconds. To see an evidence upload, set the evidence top N (`evidenceTopN`) of the board above 0 in the
 * horizOn Dashboard (the example run then lands in the top N of a new board).
 *
 * Where to set the API key: Project Settings > Plugins > horizOn SDK > API Key.
 * Drop this actor into a level and press Play to run the flow.
 *
 * Expected log output (channel LogTemp):
 *   [ValidatedActionsExample] State on <day>: <n> value(s)
 *   [ValidatedActionsExample] Starting run...
 *   [ValidatedActionsExample] Run <id> started, seed <n>
 *   [ValidatedActionsExample] Submitting score <n>, input log hash <hash>
 *   [ValidatedActionsExample] SUCCESS: best <n>, rank <n>, measured <n> s, sus <true|false>
 *   [ValidatedActionsExample]   gold: balance <n>, requested <n>, credited <n>, today <n> / <cap>
 *   [ValidatedActionsExample] Cloud save mirror: {"day":"<day>","balances":{"gold":<n>}}
 *   [ValidatedActionsExample] Evidence requested for run <id> until <time> (max <n> bytes)
 *   [ValidatedActionsExample] Evidence uploaded for run <id>: <n> bytes
 *   or
 *   [ValidatedActionsExample] REJECTED (<code>): <message>
