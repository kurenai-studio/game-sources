# Notbell lore canon

Story canon and character voices. **Spoilers throughout.** Anything that
contradicts this file is a bug; anything that extends it should be checked
against it first. Dialogue rule: lines are only what a character is *saying or
doing* — never stage narration (see AGENTS.md rule 5).

## The founding story

The island was **Lightkeep Isle**. It had a lighthouse, a keeper — **Old
Tansy** — and a bronze **bell**. In the **Great Squall** the bell went into
the sea and was never found; the island got renamed **Notbell**, half joke,
half wound. Tansy paid the salvage divers from her **button jar**, and
buttons have been the currency since — it's why your money jingles funny.

- The lighthouse light "moved" into the **glow worm cave**: the **Old Light**
  sleeps at the shrine at the very back. Speak softly.
- **Luna** keeps the old lighthouse lamp on the counter of her café, **The
  Lantern Room** (named for the top room of a lighthouse). It is still warm.
- **Fern** (museum) tells the story properly, one chapter at a donation
  milestone (1 / 3 / 6 / 10 donations, `loreToldUpTo` in state).
- Tansy's **four letters** wash up in bottles while fishing
  (`bottlesRead`).
- The old lighthouse still stands with a **polished empty hook** where the
  bell hung (on a plain wall bracket now — the old crossbar read as a
  gallows). **Murmur**, the ghost, polishes it. Someone should. Somebody
  has since wired a small **electric lamp** into the lamp room: it turns a
  modest beam over the water after dark and in weather. A newer plate:
  "IT IS NOT HER LIGHT. IT DOES ITS BEST." The Old Light is still the one in
  the cave.
- **Howell** insists he hears the bell underwater on foggy nights. Howell is
  a gray fox who insists he is a wolf. Both claims get the same treatment
  in-world: nobody argues, everybody notes it down.
- **Baron Moledecai's** fortune: his grandfather billed Tansy hourly to dive
  for the bell and *not find it*. Invoice №1 hangs in the manor.
- **Notbell Labs** was founded to hear the bell again; the listening machines
  kept getting bigger and the questions kept getting wider. That's how an
  island ends up with a rocket program.

## The bell (future quest — deliberately unbuilt)

Southeast of Notbell, in deep water, something **glints** (the pulsing GLINT
mesh near the earthball view on the moon). The rovers have charted it for
forty years. **It rings on the heavy tides.** The intended quest threads:
Howell + the shore + one genuinely foggy night; Vesper's logbook missing its
last page; the rocket/moon telescope "pointed somewhere specific." Do not
resolve any of these casually — the bell quest is a hero feature for a future
session, and half its power is that everything already points at it.

## Voice

Cozy deadpan. Jokes land soft. Nobody is mean, nobody is stupid, and the sad
parts stay gentle — melancholy is allowed, cruelty is not. Institutions are
funny because they are earnest (the Labs' flag protocol, BULKO's management
signage, the Best Rock Museum's daily democratic rock). Running gags are
load-bearing: do not explain them, do not escalate them past deadpan.

Standing gags (do not "fix", per AGENTS.md rule 7): Howell is a wolf · the
lobster tank is NOT FOR SALE ("Stop asking. —management. (the lobsters)") ·
the BULKO parking lot ("DO NOT WORRY ABOUT IT") · the chart cuts off the Labs
· the volcano never erupts, she's just comfortable · TEXAS · the Shiniest
Button (do not ask Pip) · the Buttonwagon (also do not ask Pip) · "P. Magpie
& Associates is one magpie."

## Cast

Keepers (built in their own modules, dialogue mostly in `buildings.js` /
island files):

- **Pip** — magpie, Pip's Odds & Ends. Huckster with a heart ("That's how I
  get ya!"). Daily market ledger; glut prices. Also: ad space, the
  Buttonwagon, sponsorships.
- **Luna** — moth, The Lantern Room. Quiet, warm, keeps the lamp.
- **Fern** — tortoise, Notbell Museum curator. The island's memory.
- **Chip** — cricket musician at the café (the K.K. homage; songs in
  `audio.js` SONGBOOK).
- **Barnaby** — lobster, Greens & Goods on the Far Isle. Pays 1.5× for
  produce and for parm wheels. The BULKO tank lobster is "his other cousin"
  (unspoken).
- **Brother Alder** — heron, The Listening House. The Listener faith: the
  empty belfry is the point.
- **Captain Brine** — gray goose, skipper of **the Persistent** (ferry
  network; sea story mandatory; refuses TEXAS — ask her why, have time).
- **Cinder** — iguana on the volcano rim. The volcano is comfortable.
- **Vesper** — bat, Quiet Stacks library (whispering preferred). Keeps
  Tansy's logbook — last page missing.
- **Dr. Gill** — axolotl, the clinic where nobody is ever sick. Lollipops.
- **Pecos** — fire ant, TEXAS. Slingshot, tin can, his ma's light string.
- **Gus** — tortoise, BULKO greeter (you use the lobsters' guest pass).
- **Baron Moledecai** — mole, the manor. Buys one `lantern_koi` for 800
  (flag `koiSold`). **Pemberton** penguin butlers; **Tilly** the hedgehog
  maid swears the third Baron's portrait winks; three mole pups orbit.
- **Director Strix** (owl), **Ada** (spider, weaves core memory by paw),
  **Miss Pinion** (rover kindergarten), **Pots** (cafeteria), **Dr. Hazel**
  (rockets) — Notbell Labs.
- **Murmur** — the ghost. Appears in any zone, wherever and whenever they
  please. Mostly drift-by.
- Moon rovers: **Old Sojo** (came up first, drew circles until the telescope
  could read STILL HERE), **Beacon** (speaks lamp-blink, learned from a
  certain lighthouse secondhand), **Pebble** (Best Rock Museum: one rock,
  rotated daily, democratically), **Tracks** (ten-thousand-year spirals),
  **Magnet** (lends the dust-sea rod), **Comet** (does the perimeter; gives
  `gold_star` only if you've met Miss Pinion).
- **The Fold** (`fold.js`) — the plain folk of the far shore, west of the
  Labs, off the chart by request. Sheep. Kind, unbothered, technology
  politely declined: **Elder Amos** (House of Cod; "the Cod provides,
  mostly on Tuesdays"), **Mercy** (preserves stall; the Cod provides, she
  provides lids), **Patience** (fields; named for the job), **Obed** (barn;
  has waved at the same Labs fellow every morning for eleven years),
  **Small Mercy** (lamb; holds with rockets a LITTLE, don't tell). Plain
  hats and bonnets are their uniform; the wool is their own.
- **Farther Isle** (`farther.js`) — way out past the Far Isle (a long
  ride on the Farther Line, north-east over open water), which is the
  entire joke. A campground under its own little mountain (the summit
  trail; sign the register — Sprint has written "almost" twice), kayaks,
  and a **rotating cast of campers**, a different handful each day:
  Thistle (hedgehog, three chords), Pim (penguin, packed for every
  weather), Reedy (frog, ultralight: "I am the four ounces"), Lumen (moth,
  reading by the one lantern), Gulliver (pelican, kayak guide), Dune
  (horse, sold everything but the blanket), Burrow (mole, trenches),
  Sprint (tortoise, summit by next autumn), Mallow (capybara, hammock),
  Vela (owl, stars), Cedar (boar, beans — the third bean), Juniper
  (rabbit, first time camping). **Huck** (bear, bucket hat; eleven summers camping, the RV
  grew an awning, a wall of annotated tide tables where some entries just
  say "yes" — a quiet future hook, do not resolve), **Wren** (duck,
  binoculars; logs birds because somebody should be keeping notes; never
  once remarks on being one — that IS the joke, don't touch it),
  **Cypress** (pelican, the Farther General; the pouch is the filing
  system), **Stilt** (heron, the flats; one leg, since Tuesday).

Wanderers (roster + voices + friendships in `src/villagers.js` — 16 as of
2026-07): Clover, Biscuit, Saffron, **Howell** (hatless; a wolf), Bramble,
Puddle, Admiral Greenbean, Marigold (horse, Far Isle), Ember (salamander,
Far Isle, commutes to the cave at midday, has opinions about its acoustics,
loves the rain — **not** the volcano's; that's Cinder the iguana), Tusk
(boar, wild-adjacent), Butterpat (cow), Crumb (mouse, master of the
MouseBoat), and the Grove lounge: Mochi (capybara, wears the orange — "the
orange situation simply arose"), Pondo (the other capybara), Sol and Brook
(the crocodiles; the plover birds work their teeth on commission).

Signature hats are identity: each wanderer keeps theirs; Howell pointedly has
none. New villagers need a hat decision (including "no").

**Anchored vs. roaming.** Characters who ARE their place stay in it —
Crumb (the MouseBoat), Mochi/Pondo/Sol/Brook (the springs), Ember (her hut
and her cave), the ducks (the nest) — `ANCHORED` in villagers.js. Everyone
else is a little random dude and roams: they walk the footbridge, the arch
and the causeway, or take the trains, and walk home the same way at night.

## The Dropped Crown (under the reef) — `crown.js`

Brine's grandmother said the reef was a crown a sea-queen threw away on
purpose. All true. Dive from the reef in Pip's diver's suit (you wear the
goggles and a snorkel down there — the bubble helmet is for the moon):

- **The Crown** — a ring of twelve candy-colored coral points tipped with
  glowing pearls. **Octavia** (octopus, costume tiara) was never a queen,
  "just a very tired octopus holding a very heavy hat"; she threw the crown
  off the edge of the world and now everyone lives in it. **Delphine** (a
  dolphin with legs, in sneakers, always running). **Bernard** (a blue
  whale — "the largest animal that has ever lived" — exactly as tall as
  everyone else, in a top hat; walks the Highway every morning, doctor's
  orders; the doctor is a sea cucumber). **Gil & Marina** (fish-folk who
  grew legs because evolution was taking too long; jogging, forever).
  **Sequin** (glitter crab, gossip). The giant clam makes one pearl a day.
- **Kelpwood** — the kelp forest; otters holding hands on the surface
  above. **Ranger Holdfast** keeps the **Kelp Highway**: the road that
  links every neighborhood, with bubbles that carry you along it.
- **The Lady Button** — Moledecai Salvage Co.'s barge, sunk hunting the
  bell, now "luxury residences" (exposed beams, original barnacles, a
  jellyfish chandelier). **Maurice** the eel is the doorman; **Mister
  Periwinkle** (hermit crab) is the broker; a sea cucumber in a bow tie is
  the sommelier. Survey marker 38: "BELL: NOT FOUND HERE EITHER."
  **Unit 0 — the bilge — is not for sale; something glints on the heavy
  tides.** (A bell hook: do not resolve.)
- **The Glow** — the trench. Plankton that light up when you move through
  them ("oh! hello!"), waltzing jellyfish, lanternfish, and **Lanterne** the
  anglerfish: "Up there you had a lighthouse. Down here, you have me." On
  the heavy tides she hears something ring, far off, once. (Same hook.)

## The Burrough (under the islands) — `burrough.js`

The moles were here first. Everyone up top knows a mole or two; nobody up
top asks where they go home to. Down. Two ways in: a **molehill on the
little hill in the Labs meadow**, ringed with flowers (Boring Dept. staff
entrance, visitors welcome)
and a **little arched door in the back wall of the Moledecai wine cellar**
("SERVICE ENTRANCE"). The distance between them is not to scale; nothing
down here is. There is no reason to go except mole tourism, and that is the
reason.

- **The Boring Line** — one open-sided green streetcar on a wire. The tunnel
  runs on past both ends into the dark; nobody has been to either end
  (Mödel: it cannot be proved to have one). The
  Boring Department dug it in one night; the paperwork took eleven years.
  Ring the bell pull and it comes; it waits for anyone standing on the
  track. "Mind the gap. There is always a gap."
- **The Works** (under the Labs) — **Boring Dept. Local 1** ("15 MINUTES
  FOR EVERY MOLE"). **Bertha**, shop steward: the Labs hired the Department
  for the listening wells ("nobody hears through rock like a mole"); Wendell
  has been on his fifteen since spring and nobody checks — solidarity. The
  punch clock stamps VISITOR — ON THE CLOCK. **Tuppence** (hamster) runs the
  Visitors' Bureau: dirt globes (they always settle) and the Daily Dirt.
  **Auger** walks the track west and back ("we dug it in one night; nobody
  ever said which night"). Inside **Local 1**: **Doris** at the front desk
  (very exasperated; a hard candy dish; "take a number — we are out of
  numbers"), **Ping** in IT ("have you tried filling it in and digging it
  again?"; a core memory Ada wove sits humming in a drawer), and engineers
  **Gauge & Plumb** at the chalkboard (Plan C is Bertha's: "down").
- **The Institute for Deep Study** — up a quiet lane: **Mould Hall** (red
  brick, a cupola clock nobody winds), mushroom woods, a blackboard ("this
  tunnel cannot be proved to have an end. PROOF: (keep digging)"). No
  students, no classes, no hurry; the Labs send down their hardest questions
  and get back better ones. **Professor Mödel** (mole; fedora, spectacles,
  scarf — it is cold, he checked): true tunnels that cannot be dug, a flaw
  in Article Four of the Burrough charter (do not mention it at his
  hearing), and a lane he walks every day for two, since the colleague he
  admired stopped walking it with him. **Professor Emerita Rosalind** (naked
  mole rat): emerita so long they ran out of cake; tea at four, always four;
  Mödel checks her tea before she drinks it, and both of those things are
  love. Inside Mould Hall: the fire, the founder's portrait (A. Mole, "dug
  here, thought here"), **Dr. Fennimore** (hamster, thinking since Tuesday)
  and **Dr. Pell** (groundhog, asleep under a book; it's a method).
- **Loam Street** (midtown) — **the Loamsworth Arms** (four floors of round
  windows, laundry that takes nine years to dry, rent-controlled since the
  Squall), **Beaumont** the doorman (burgundy, gold braid, top hat, white
  gloves), a lobby with an elevator out of order since the Squall, and
  **2B**: **Sorrel** (hamster, beanie, big glasses; into the Burrough before
  it was underground), exposed original dirt, vinyl, and **Gerald**, a
  sourdough starter who is doing really well. **Mrs. Loamsworth** at her
  second-floor window. **Thelonious
  Mole** busks on the corner (beret, dark glasses, sax; tip the hat and he
  plays "Mind the Gap"; "the other bell's none of my business").
  **Nibs** (hamster) sells **hot worms**, which contain no worms and never
  have: they are churros, named by her grandmother, a hamster of vision.
  **The Daily Dirt** ("All the News That's Fit to Dig") and its ethics desk,
  **Lowell** — a worm, with legs (six, in sneakers). He is investigating the
  hot worm cart, daily, by eating one. Where the legs came from: **no
  comment. Running gag — never explain the legs.** **Marjorie** (groundhog)
  forecasts the *surface* weather from a soapbox and is always wrong (she
  reads the real weather and says the opposite); thirty-one years, "you can
  plan around me," to a small loyal crowd who shake their heads and come
  back tomorrow. Inside **the Daily Dirt**: **Mudge** (groundhog editor,
  green visor: "nine thousand words is a book"), the obituaries, sports,
  crossword and culture desks (the crossword answer is always BURROW),
  **Dex** hosting **Tunnel Vision** ("a podcast about the spaces between
  spaces"), and the **Little Desk Sessions** (the Loam Rangers). **Spoke** (hamster) is Burrough Electric: one wheel,
  every lamp in Midtown; if they flicker, he's waving.
- **Uptown** (under the manor) — **The Moledecai**, the family's old
  building; the family "went upstairs" three Barons ago. **Fitzgerald**
  keeps the door and a list nobody is on; the Baron sends a card every
  winter: "Keep the door." The pups visit through the cellar and run the
  stoop eleven times. Up on the fourth floor: **Mrs. Vanderburrow**
  (pearls, a stole, "you must be somebody"), a painting of the sky (artist's
  impression — she's told it's blue), vintage dew from the Squall year, and
  **Pomme**, a pill bug, who rolls up when pleased (or frightened, or it's
  Tuesday). **Central Mulch**: three mushrooms, a moss lawn, and
  **Mr. Hollis** (groundhog, retired forecaster, right every time, nobody
  came) feeding the beetles.
- The bell: **down here they hear it through the rock on the heavy tides**
  (Auger, Fitzgerald, the Daily Dirt: residents "not surprised," "a nice
  sound"). Nobody up top has ever asked them. A bell hook — do not resolve.

## Oasis Estates (south-west, off the chart) — `oasis.js`

A Planned Community, on an island that didn't happen so much as get
approved: a flat oval of lawn (two and a half inches, mown in stripes,
green in every season by covenant), seven identical houses — **the
Standard** — around **the Circle**, the Commons (Trader Polly's and
Dromedeals under one roof, the **CaMall**, Mirage Coffee and Cluck & Co. on
the Parkway), a community pool nobody is ever in, and a gatehouse whose boom
is always up. South-west of Notbell and wholly off the chart's west edge.
**One ferry.** After fourteen applications from Captain Brine (the horn
was too loud, the boat was too loud, the sea is frankly very loud), the HOA
approved exactly **one** route: **Oasis Estates ↔ BULKO**, for paper towels,
parmesan and the rotisserie item ("bulk goods are consistent with the
character of the community"). Every other destination remains under
review — to get anywhere else you go via the warehouse. Knock on the buoy
on the east pier (its bell removed, per Article 9). The Persistent is now,
officially, a paper towel boat; Brine has feelings about this.

- **Not roads.** BULKO's sign is right: there are no roads on any island.
  Oasis Estates has four point six miles of **parkway, drive, and circle**,
  in asphalt, with a dashed yellow line, for walking on. There was a
  meeting. ("THIS IS NOT A ROAD. IT IS A PARKWAY. — THE HOA.") The cars in
  the lot and the driveways are warm, parked, and never seen driven — same
  as BULKO's. Don't explain either.
- **Beverly Humphries** (camel; visor, pearls, clipboard) — President of
  the HOA. Catty, serious, and not to be messed with: step on the Humphries
  lawn and she hands you a **Notice of Violation** (`hoa_notice`, "see
  attached"; nothing is attached; that is also a violation). Ask who elected
  her and you get another. Tell her she's doing a great job and — once —
  she says thank you and asks you not to tell anyone. Her want: that nothing
  on this island ever blows away again (the Squall took the lawn chairs, the
  laundry, a whole gazebo; the covenant's Article 17 has not forgiven it).
  Forty-one Yards of the Month in a row; the forty-second nail is already
  in. She keeps everyone's birthdays in a file marked "Violations."
  **Harold**, her husband, mows where she tells him and loves the part of
  Volume Three about mailboxes.
- **The bell hook (do not resolve):** Article 9 of the covenant forbids
  bells — doorbells, bike bells, wind chimes, cowbells, the ice cream
  truck's song (it still comes, in silence). Nobody knows why; the developer
  wrote it into the deed: **Moledecai Developments**. A margin note in the
  covenant, very old: "ask Moledecai why." Under it: "Do not." Trader
  Polly's has a polished brass bell mount with no bell on it and a card:
  PLEASE SAY "BRRRING." So Pico does.
- **The Circle:** the Humphries; the **Featherstones** (parrots — Grandpa
  **Sal** repeats the TV, **Sunny** repeats everything to Beverly, **Kiwi**
  sings in the band); the **Brontos** (**Gary**, a brontosaurus, grills
  burgers that have been almost ready since noon and can see over every
  fence — mostly what he sees is Beverly coming; **Linda** likes the green
  part of the game; **Junior** plays bass); **Todd** (camel, riding mower,
  stripes; mows Harold's because Harold mows Beverly's) and the twins, who
  will mow the ocean; **the Open House** (Tiffany the parrot, always there;
  four bed, three bath, exactly like the others, which is the selling
  point; the cookies are for the smell; 3,200,000 buttons before HOA fees);
  the **Dunes** (Chad and Madison, new parents, moved here for the schools —
  there aren't any schools; every box is BOX 12; baby **Sahara**, four
  weeks old, already unimpressed); **Mildred & Walt** (Walt watches golf for
  the whispering; butterscotch from '94 is forever; **Dolores** the lawn
  flamingo is angled, always, at wherever Beverly is standing).
- **No Outlet** — the garage band in the Brontos' garage (Kiwi, vocals and
  guitar; Junior, bass; Dakota, a camel, drums). They are getting out of
  this town. Their first single, "Cul-de-Sac," goes around and around and
  doesn't lead anywhere, and that's the point. Noise permit: Tuesdays, 2–4.
  Every day is Tuesday if you believe in something. Nobody is leaving yet.
  They're practicing (on the lawn; nobody's allowed in the pool).
- **The Commons:** **Trader Polly's** (Captain **Mango**, a scarlet macaw
  in a floral shirt, sells dried mango and has made his peace with it —
  mostly; **Pico** at the till; Everything But The Bell seasoning; the
  Fearless Feather, whose letter asking why there's no bell has gone
  unanswered for eleven years). **Dromedeals** (brand names, one hump or
  two; **Deb**; compare-at prices are a feeling; the ceramic pineapples
  come in every shipment and nobody ordered one; the tennis visor, compare
  at 900, is 30). **Mirage** ("coffee, probably"; **Echo**, an African grey,
  repeats every order back, every "um"; sizes Small, Medium, Dune; your
  name on the cup, nearly). **Cluck & Co.** ("it's our pleasure"; **Tanner**;
  the chick'n contains no chicken and never has — see the Burrough's hot
  worms; closed Sundays; the cow on the roof can spell and is making a
  choice).
- **The CaMall:** a fountain (wishes cost one button), **Auntie Dune's**
  pretzels, **Sahara** (Paloma; Eau de Oasis — top notes cut grass, heart
  chlorine, base a minivan in the sun), **Hot Tropic** (closed; it's always
  closed; Kiwi's cousin is asleep on a beanbag; the walkers have never gone
  in — they're not ready), Sunglass Hump, SPACE AVAILABLE ("COMING SOON:
  HOT WORMS, a Burrough franchise, contains no worms"), an escalator to a
  second floor there isn't (at the top, a painting of one), **Rico** at the
  lotion kiosk ("can I ask you a question?"), **Officer Dale** (bronto,
  segway, "you'll never be fast, but you can be steady"), and the **mall
  walkers** — **Mildred, Phyllis and Bunny**, three camels in matching
  visors, forty laps a day, since seven.
- **Reggie** (a small grey parrot in a cap and sunglasses, on a stool out
  front of the gatehouse) is security. Sassy. Keeps a list nobody is on,
  "just to watch you wait." The boom is up because he is generous.
- **Out and about:** residents step out to the shops and to each other's
  houses from seven till eleven (Harold to Trader Polly's for the seasoning,
  Sunny on Beverly's errands, Linda down the yellow line of the Parkway,
  Chad and Madison on the Mirage loop); while they're out, they aren't
  home. Indoors, folk walk about their rooms and turn to look at you.

## The strait: Chuckee's — `chuckee.js`

Between the Labs' south beach and Oasis Estates' north tip: a footbridge
(the HOA paid for the lamp posts, and every one flies an Oasis Estates
banner), and beside it a **highway**, with cars on it, driving. It starts
and ends in a turnaround loop out over the water, a stride short of either
shore — **there are no roads on any island**, and there still aren't; the
highway is *between* islands ("END OF HIGHWAY: there are no roads on any
island"). The cars loop it forever, wait for anyone on the road, and half of
them stop at the drive-thru. Nobody has seen who drives them. Don't worry
about it. In the middle, on an islet the size of a parking lot: **Chuckee's**,
the travel stop (a woodchuck in a red cap on a pole sign both islands can
see). Brisket, fudge, Chuckee Nuggets, the jerky wall, three pumps on the
footbridge side no car can reach, and the **cleanest restrooms on any
water**. Chuckee misses being asked how much wood a woodchuck would chuck.

## The Isle of Cran — `cran.js`

South-east of Notbell, over a footbridge from Grove Isle. A cranberry bog:
dark moss older than the seasons, live oaks hung with Spanish moss, a creek
that cuts the island in two (cranberries drift down it to the sea), the bog
beds on the east bank — one flooded for the harvest, its berries floating
edge to edge ("please do not swim in the product") — and a village on the
west bank.

- **Barb** (snapping turtle; the moss on her shell is her hat) and **Ruth**
  (box turtle; knits; a scarf for the creek) have sat by the creek forty
  years and said about a hundred words, ninety of them "look." They share
  Barb's house. Barb has "RUTH" tattooed on her shell, in a heart. Ruth
  pretends it's silly and visits it every day. Anchored to the creek.
- **Null** (black cat; a hacker; headphones): "like the value, not like
  nothing." Changed the Labs' password from "bell" to "notbell" two years
  ago; nobody's noticed. The island runs on one router in a mossy log.
  **Mabel** (goose; the party cone was on a birthday that wasn't using it)
  doesn't steal, she relocates. Best enemies with Barb. Null backs things
  up into the goose. Both roam.
- **Bog Ink** (Spike, a skunk with a mohawk; tattoos and rock and roll; "NO
  BELLS — they never come out right"), **Low Tide Records** (Sloane, a
  sloth, slowly; the listening booth plays the island's songs), and the
  **Cran Community Center**: zumba (Coach Lily; Barb in the back row, not
  doing the arms; the goose banned from the front), watercolor (Miss
  Dabble; everyone's bog comes out a pink smudge, which is accurate), and
  **Chocoholics Anonymous** (Coco; "we don't judge the cheek"; Ruth keeps
  bringing brownies "for support").
- The **gazebo** has no bell in its cupola. It's a gazebo; nobody on Cran
  thinks that's a question. The **flower pots** around it are rearranged
  every morning by the Tuesday group (and on other days, by someone).
- The **bench under the big oak** on the east shore: sit, and look at the
  sea, until you choose to get up. Sometimes something glints far off on
  the water. You let it be a glint. (A bell hook — do not resolve.)

## The mail — `mail.js`

**Penny** (a pigeon in a postal cap, with a blue satchel) carries it. Moss
sorts; Penny walks every letter to its neighbor's box (bridges, trains, the
lot), the flag goes up, and when they've written back she brings the answer
to yours. Now and then a neighbor writes first. "The happy ones sit up
straight in the bag."

## The night sky

Constellations (sky.js): **The Bell** (one star missing — the clapper; the
sailors say it fell in the Great Squall), The Hook, The Button, **The Wolf
(a fox)** (per Howell; the committee gently disagrees), The Big Parmesan
(BULKO asked to sponsor it; denied), The Lantern. The Labs roof telescope
names them at night. On clear nights stars come loose (starfall.js) —
catch one in the net before it lands.

## Places with rules

- **The Listening House** — a faith of listening; candles counted in
  `flags.candlesLit`. Never give the belfry a bell. (The bell-cote over the
  front gable is tall and open on purpose: an empty hook where a bell
  would hang.)
- **BULKO** — legally-distinct warehouse club, ferry-only. The 1.5-button hot
  dog has cost that "since the sea had a bell"; your change is **half a
  button**, a keepsake, and the price plaque is quietly about the lore.
- **The Labs flag** — wool, so it comes in when it rains; half-mast on Bell
  Day, for the bell.
- **Holidays** (`calendar.js`): New Year's, May Day, **Bell Day (Jun 21)**,
  Spooky Eve, the Frost Festival.
- **The moon** — craters named after feelings; the archipelago hangs
  overhead; rovers moved there *if they wanted to*. Consent is the
  kindergarten's whole theme.
- **The House of Cod** (zone `kirk`) — the Fold's plain meetinghouse. No
  steeple, no bell, and no bell-longing either: a carved wooden cod hangs
  from the rafters and services are whenever the weather says so. **This is
  a parallel lore lane** — it is NOT the Listener faith, it is not in
  dialogue with the Listener faith, and the Fold has no opinion about the
  bell. Do not give them one. (Sharing an island with the Labs is not
  strange to anybody; both sides wave. That's the whole treaty.)
- **The Fold stays off the chart** — its island info is registered keyless
  on purpose (the HUD names it, the chart never will). They asked politely.
- **The Farther General** (zone `general`) — "We have it. If we don't,
  come back Thursday — the tide usually brings one in." A full shop now:
  camp food (marshmallows, trail mix, the third bean), gear (flashlight —
  a pool of light ahead of you after dark —, lantern, bug spray, compass),
  keepsakes (the mug, the postcard). The third bean is never identified.
  Keep it that way.
- **Farther Isle, the back** — past the neck of sand, east: **Gordy** (skunk),
  his trailer, a lawn chair, a TV that gets one channel (a fishing show; the
  same episode; he has a feeling this time), and a cooler of Big Moose Root
  Beer. His first line is canon: *"I thought it was the Farter Isle."*
  Every tent and RV at Farther can be walked into.
- **The sharks have names** — Gummy (the strait; self-conscious about the
  teeth), Aunt Doris (south of home; forty years going round), Finnegan
  (off the Far Isle; would like to be a dolphin). Swim or row up to chat.
- **The Labs grounds** (`labsgrounds.js`) — the wildflower trial plot (Azure
  the butterfly, "PH.D. in not being a moth"; Buzz the bee, reports, does
  not brag), the gift kiosk (Dot; science-adjacent merch), the **emo baby
  rover** behind it "vaping" water vapor (the moon is so mainstream), the
  blueberry bushes nobody planted, and the south beach: rovers on towels,
  a sandcastle, a ball that never drops, and Wendell the mole on his union
  break. The Labs love a picnic table.
- **The telephone** — one line, two booths, one at each end of the North
  Isle ↔ Labs causeway. It calls the other end of the bridge. That's it.
- **The poison frog** (North Isle) sits on a mossy stone by a sign that
  says PLEASE DO NOT LICK THE FROG. Nobody has.
- **The Farther Line** (`farline.js`) — the third railway, salt-teal
  livery, Far Isle south shore → Farther Isle, over open water. An engine
  on EACH end (the B2 two-engine doctrine, first implemented here): no
  turntable, no turn-around — the one in front pulls, the one behind takes
  half the credit. Never give it a turntable.

## Other future hooks on the shelf

- A museum wing for Tansy's letters once all four are fished up.
- Vesper's missing logbook page (ties into the bell).
- The rocket's heart chamber / lightseed chain is built through launch; the
  moon is live. The earthball GLINT is the next thread.
