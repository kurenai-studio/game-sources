-- Every number that changes how the game plays, in one place.

-- This file is for balance, not content: multipliers, growth rates, thresholds and
-- timers live here and nowhere else. Individual prices and effects (what an agent
-- costs, what a tool does) stay with their rows in data/, because they are content
-- you edit item by item.
--
-- Nothing here should be a copy of a data row: if a number is needed in two modules,
-- it lives here and both read it. tests/headless.lua proves the modules consume these
-- values by changing one at runtime and watching the result move.
