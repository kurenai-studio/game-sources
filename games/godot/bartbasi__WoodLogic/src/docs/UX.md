# WoodLogic UX

Owner: ux-designer. Status: updated after Hard Stop 1 (the GDD is approved and Bart chose the
Workshop look, docs/design/directions.md), and again on 21 October 2026 after Bart played
Phase 3 on a Galaxy Z Fold5 (coffee buttons, Settings from Pause, one nav dock, the progress map
and the Info screen), and a third time on the same day after Bart's answers (coffee in the top
bar, Info confirmed, "Back to level" goes straight into the level), and on 22 October 2026 for
Phase 5 (the tray changes size by level, new helper prices, gifts at levels 50 and 100).
Anything that depends on a number the game designer owns is tagged `[C:name]` (a layout count)
or `[GDD]` (a value that comes from docs/GDD.md, now filled in). When those change, search
this file for the tag.

Writing rules for every string in this file: plain words, no em dashes, no double hyphens,

## 1. Global rules

### 1.1 Units and layout classes

- Everything is in design units. The base viewport is 360 x 640. Stretch mode is
  `canvas_items`, aspect `expand`. The viewport grows taller on tall phones and wider on tablets,
  and the scale stays the same in the other direction.
- On a phone 360 dp wide or wider, one unit is at least one dp. A 48 unit target is at least
  48 dp.
- **Content rect.** All layouts below are given in content coordinates: x from the left edge of
  the content rect, y from its top edge. The content rect is the viewport minus the safe-area
  insets (section 1.2). On the level screen it is the whole rect (the board scales into it,
  section 3.2.1a). On every other screen it is no wider than 480 units, centered when the
  viewport is wider.
  Backgrounds, wood and shadows are full bleed, behind the insets. Controls and text stay
  inside the content rect.
- The budget numbers assume a top inset of 24 units and a bottom inset of 16, so the content
  rect of a 360 x 640 screen is **360 x 600**. If the real insets are larger, flexible gaps
  absorb up to 12 units; past that, the top bar shrinks from 44 to 40 and the pause button keeps
  its 48 unit target by growing into the gap. The board never shrinks.
- **Bottom half** means y 300 and below in a 600 tall content rect (the lower half of the
  content rect on any height). Every primary button lives there.

| Class | Viewport (units) | Where it appears | What changes |
|-|-|-|-|
| Base | 360 x 640 | small and older phones, 16:9 | the reference layout |
| Tall | 360 x 641 to 360 x 930 | 18:9, 19.5:9, 20:9, 21:9 phones, and a folded foldable (the Galaxy Z Fold5 cover screen is 360 x 922) | extra height, see section 3.2 and each screen's "Tall" note |
| Wide | 361 x 640 to 480 x 640 (aspect up to 3:4) | tablets in portrait | level screen: stacked, the board view scales up and the bars shrink to make room (3.2.1a). Other screens: column up to 480, buttons at most 320 wide |
| Beyond | aspect wider than 3:4, or wider than 480 units | unfolded foldables, near square windows | level screen: stacked or split, whichever gives the larger board (3.2.1a). Other screens: column fixed at 480, centered, the sides show only the background |

A tablet shows everything at a larger physical size because the height sets the scale there.
The level screen uses that extra room (section 3.2.1a); other screens do not need to.
Nothing is laid out for landscape; the game is portrait only, and a near square or wide window
(an unfolded foldable) is treated as the Beyond class.

### 1.2 Safe areas

- Read the safe area from the display (`DisplayServer.get_display_safe_area()`) and convert it
  to viewport units. Re-read it when the window changes.
- Controls and text stay inside the safe rect plus a margin of 12 units on each side.
- Primary buttons keep at least 8 units above the bottom safe edge, so a gesture bar swipe
  does not hit them.

### 1.3 Type

The font is Godot's default. All text sits on a plaque (a solid or near solid panel, never
bare wood or the textured board), so contrast does not depend on the wood theme.

| Style | Size (units) | Weight | Used for |
|-|-|-|-|
| Display | 32 | bold | title screen name, nothing else |
| Heading | 24 | bold | screen titles, sheet headings |
| Button primary | 22 | bold | Play, Next, Retry, Resume |
| Button | 18 | bold | all other buttons and row labels |
| Tutorial line | 18 | bold | the line under the board |
| Body | 16 | regular | sentences, dialog text, About |
| Small | 14 | regular | row notes, legal text, stat captions |
| Caption | 13 | regular | the smallest allowed: helper names, star captions, coffee chip |

No text is smaller than 13 units. Numbers use the font's tabular digits if it has them, so the
timer does not jitter.

### 1.4 Shared components

Sizes are minimums. Look comes from docs/DESIGN.md.

- **Button.** Height at least 48. Primary 72 tall (title Play, Next) or 64 tall (Retry,
  Resume). Width 296 when full width (a 360 wide screen with 32 side margin) or 144 when two
  share a row with an 8 gap. Four kinds: primary (filled, strong), secondary (filled, calm),
  quiet (outline or text, used for the coffee chip and other low emphasis actions), danger (used
  only for "Erase everything").
  States: normal, pressed (down: scale 0.96, darker, within one frame), disabled (dimmed and
  its reason is visible as text or an icon), focused (a visible outline of at least 3 units for
  keyboards and gamepads). A button acts on release. A finger that slides off the button
  cancels it.
- **No on-screen Back button.** The menu screens have no Back button of their own any more. The
  nav dock (1.6) is at the bottom of each of them, and the Android back button does the rest
  (section 4.2). The header has no back arrow, because the top is out of thumb reach.
- **Toggle row.** The whole row is the target (full width x 56). It shows a label, an optional
  note, a switch 56 x 32 and the words "On" or "Off" beside the switch, so state is never only
  color or position.
- **Sheet.** A panel that slides up from the bottom edge (250 ms, ease out). The board stays
  visible and dimmed above it. Used for out of room and for helper explanations.
- **Dialog.** A centered panel 304 wide for a short question, with buttons stacked in the
  bottom half of the panel. The background dims by 55 percent. Used for reset and for buying a
  helper.
- **Toast.** A one line plaque 24 units above the bottom edge, shown 2 seconds, never blocks a
  tap. Only one at a time; a new one replaces the old.
- **Plaque.** The solid panel behind any text. Contrast rules in section 7.2.
- **Star icon.** A five point star: filled means earned, outline only means not earned. The two
  differ in shape, not only color.

### 1.5 Motion rules

- Every button press answers in the same frame it is pressed.
- Screen changes are a 150 ms fade or a 250 ms slide. Never faster than that, never a flash.
- No looping motion faster than one cycle per second. No brightness jump over a large area.
  Nothing flashes (section 7.5).

### 1.6 Menu frame and nav dock (decided by Bart, 21 October 2026)

Every screen other than the level itself shares one frame: a header, a body and one **nav dock**
at the bottom. That covers the title, the progress map, Stats, Info, Settings, About, License,
Credits and Relaxed setup. The level, Pause, level clear, out of room, the helper sheets and the
dialogs belong to the level and have no dock.

**Why the bottom.** The dock is at the bottom, not the top, because a right or left thumb rests
at the bottom of the screen, every primary button in this game is in the bottom half, and the top
corners are the hardest place to reach. It also puts the way back to the game exactly where the
Resume and Play buttons already are.

**Frame geometry (content 360 x 600, base):**

| Part | Rect (x, y, w, h) | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| Header | 0, 0, 360, 56 | the screen's heading (Heading 24) at x 12, centered vertically; the coffee chip on the right (1.7) where the screen has one |
| Body | 0, 56, 360, 416 | scrolls when its content is taller. On screens without a game row it runs to y 532 (476 tall), see below |
| Game row | 12, 480, 336, 52 | one brass primary button, see below |
| Tab row | 12, 540, 336, 52 | six tabs, 56 x 52 each, no gaps; ends 8 units above the bottom edge |

Screens without a game row (the title, which has its own big Play button, and Relaxed setup,
whose buttons start a game) have a body that runs to y 532.

**Screens and what they show:**

| Screen | Header | Game row | Tab row, active tab |
|-|-|-|-|
| Title | star bank at the left, coffee chip at the right | no | yes, Home |
| Progress map | "Progress map", coffee chip | yes | yes, Map |
| Stats | "Stats", coffee chip | yes | yes, Stats |
| Info | "How to play", coffee chip | yes | yes, Info |
| Settings | "Settings", coffee chip | yes | yes, Settings |
| About | "About", no chip (its Supporting block is the coffee button there) | yes | yes, About |
| License, Credits | "License" or "Credits", no chip | yes | yes, About |
| Relaxed setup | "Relaxed", coffee chip | no | yes, Home |

**The tab row.** Six tabs in this order: "Home", "Map", "Stats", "Info", "Settings", "About". Each
is an icon (22 units, drawn in code) above its label (Caption 13), a 56 x 52 target. Tapping a tab
goes to that screen at once (a 150 ms cross fade; the dock itself does not move or animate). The
active tab is shown three ways, so it is never color alone: a raised or pressed plaque shape,
a 3 unit bar above its label, and a bold label. Tapping the active tab scrolls that screen's body
back to the top and does nothing else. "Home" goes to the title. Icons for the graphic designer:
a house, a trail of dots, a small bar chart, an "i" in a circle, a gear, and a screw head for
About.

**The game row.** The way back to the player's game, one tap, always the same place.
- If a level is **paused** (section 4.1 says when): the label is "Back to level" with the note
  "Level {n}, paused" (or "Daily, paused", or "Relaxed, paused"). **A tap goes straight into the
  level (decided by Bart, 21 October 2026)**, with no Pause screen in between. The menu fades
  out over 150 ms and the board is shown; the clock starts again when the board is showing (when
  that fade has finished), and only if it had already started, because before the first action
  it stays at 0:00.
- Otherwise: the label is "Play" with the note "Level {n}", where n is the player's next level.
  A tap starts that level, exactly as the title's Play button does.

**Tall and wide.** The dock stays anchored to the bottom of the content rect on every height, so
the body grows on tall screens (a Galaxy Z Fold5 folded is 360 x 922 units). On wide screens the
dock follows the content column (at most 480): the tab row keeps six equal tabs, 76 wide at 480,
and the game row matches its width. On a foldable opened out (533 x 640 units) the column is 480
wide and centered.

**Never in the dock:** badges, counters, dots, or animation of any kind.

### 1.7 The coffee button (decided by Bart, 21 October 2026)

Bart: "add a buy me a coffee button to the home screen, the play screen, and the settings, about,
and info screens. Let's make it easy for someone to buy me a coffee." Ground rule 1 still holds:
nothing may interrupt play to ask for anything. So it is a button that waits to be tapped, and
nothing more.

**What it is.** The chip: a cup icon drawn in code (20 units) and the text "Buy me a coffee"
(Caption 13), quiet style. Visible size 140 x 32 inside a 140 x 48 target, at the top right of
the screen (target rect 208, 0, 140, 48). It is in the same place on every screen that has it,
so a player learns where it is once. It opens the one fixed address
(https://buymeacoffee.com/playinc) with no confirmation.

**Where it appears:**

| Screen | Coffee |
|-|-|
| Title | the chip, top right |
| Level (play) | **the top bar**, an icon only cup at the far left (below), from level 4; and the chip inside Pause |
| Progress map, Stats, Info, Settings, Relaxed setup | the chip, top right of the header |
| About | the "Supporting WoodLogic" block with its full width "Buy me a coffee" button (3.9). No header chip, so there are not two on one screen. |
| License, Credits | none |
| Level clear, out of room, helper sheets, dialogs | **never**. A win or a loss is not a moment to ask, so the top bar's cup is hidden while the clear screen, the out of room sheet, a helper sheet or a dialog is showing. |

**The play screen: the top bar (decided by Bart, 21 October 2026).** I first proposed Pause; Bart
chose the top bar, so it is on screen while playing. To make that as safe as it can be:
1. **Far end, far from the board and from Pause.** It sits at the far left of the top bar, 256
   units from the pause button at the far right, so a thumb heading for Pause cannot land on it.
2. **Clear of every screw.** The top bar ends at y 44 and the board panel starts at y 176, so the
   cup's target (48 x 48 at the top left) is at least 126 units from the nearest possible screw
   target (screws sit at least 22 units inside the board core, so a screw target begins at
   y 174 or lower on the screen). No target of the cup and no target of a screw can overlap or
   touch.
3. **The board's touch area stops short of it.** The board only listens inside the board
   panel rectangle. A touch that starts in the top bar, the boxes row, the tray or the helper bar
   never goes to the board, and a touch that starts on the board never goes to the cup. The cup
   has no larger or snapping target, only its own 48 x 48 (section 6.1, hit testing).
4. **A deliberate touch only.** Like every button it acts on release, and only if the finger
   went down on it and is still on it. A finger sliding in from elsewhere does nothing.
5. **Visible but quiet.** An icon only cup (24 units, drawn in code) on a low emphasis plaque,
   with the accessible name "Buy me a coffee". No animation, no badge, no counter, no accent
   color, no change after a tap.
6. **Not in the first minute.** It appears with the other top bar items, from level 4 (the GDD's
   level for the timer and pips), so levels 1 to 3 are just the board and the pause button, and a
   new player is never shown it before they have had a chance to enjoy the game.
7. **Never at the moments of a win or a loss,** and never over a sheet or a dialog (it is hidden
   while those show).
8. **A tap pauses the level first.** The tap opens Pause in the same frame (the board covered,
   the clock stopped) and only then hands the address to the phone. Opening the browser leaves
   the app, so the level is already paused when focus is lost; coming back shows the Pause
   screen on the same level (section 4.3). Nothing is lost.
9. **Pause keeps the chip too.** The full "Buy me a coffee" chip stays top right in Pause (3.3),
   where there is room for the words.

**Behavior rules.** No pop-up, no badge, no counter, no reminder, no animation, no change in look
after a tap, no sound other than the normal button press. It never moves into the middle of a
screen. It never appears on a timer or after an event.

**Leaving the app.** Opening the browser leaves the app, so the app loses focus. On the level
screen the tap pauses the level first (point 8), and in Pause it is already paused, so the clock
is stopped either way. When the player comes back they are on the same Pause screen, the same
level (section 4.3).

**One switch to hide every coffee button (store build).** Google Play has warned apps over
donation links to recipients that are not tax-exempt charities (AnkiDroid, September 2026), so
every coffee button can be hidden at once.
- There is exactly one place that decides: a single function (suggested name
  `Links.coffee_visible() -> bool` in src/ui/links.gd) that every coffee control asks. The lead
  records it in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md. Suggested source: a custom feature tag, `no_coffee`, set in
  the store export preset, tested with `OS.has_feature("no_coffee")`, so ordinary builds show it
  and the store build hides it with one setting and no code change. Whatever the source, it is
  one switch.
- When it is off, the controls are **not built at all** (not just invisible), and
  `Links.open_coffee()` refuses to open anything, so a bug cannot open the address.
- **Every screen must still look right with it hidden.** Header chips sit in an otherwise empty
  corner, so nothing moves: the title keeps its star bank at the left, Pause and the other
  headers just show their heading. In the level's top bar the level label takes the cup's place
  and the bar goes back to the layout without it (3.2.2). In About the whole "Supporting WoodLogic" block disappears
  (heading, fixed text and button), and the Privacy block uses its store build wording (below).
  A test builds every screen with the switch off.
- **Privacy wording with the switch off.** The fixed Privacy statement names the Buy me a coffee
  button, which would not exist in that build. Proposed store build wording, which needs Bart's
  approval because CLAUDE.md fixes the original: "WoodLogic collects nothing: no ads, no
  tracking, no internet. The game itself sends nothing." (See section 11.)
- With the switch off the game hands only two fixed addresses to the phone (feedback and source
  code); docs/store/privacy-policy.md, the store listing and the security review need to match.

## 2. Counts that drive the layout

Defaults from the brief. The game designer may change them in the GDD. If one changes, the
layouts tagged with it must be redone by the ux-designer; do not just stretch them.

| Tag | Meaning | Default | Layout that depends on it |
|-|-|-|-|
| `[C:open]` | open boxes at once | 2 | boxes row (3.2.2), box width, the out of room rule |
| `[C:slots]` | slots per box | 3 | open box width 92 (3 wells of 24 + gaps), lid closes on slot 3, preview box |
| `[C:prev]` | boxes previewed in the queue | 2 | preview boxes 62 wide each, boxes row total width |
| `[C:tray]` | tray slots | **5, 4 or 3 by level** (3.2.2): 5 up to level 11 and in the tutorial, 4 on levels 12 to 20, 3 from level 21 and in the daily, Relaxed 5 `[GDD: pending]`; plus 1 with Extra slot | tray frame width 160, 210 or 260 (210, 260 or 310 with Extra slot); the tray warning at one free slot |

Width check for the boxes row (usable width 336 = 360 minus 12 each side):
`open * 92 + (open - 1) * 8 + 12 + prev * 62 + (prev - 1) * 8`. With the defaults that is
`2*92 + 8 + 12 + 2*62 + 8 = 336`. It fits exactly. Any change that makes it larger than 336
needs a new layout (smaller wells down to 20 units, or two rows). Ask the ux-designer.

Tray width check: `slots * 44 + (slots - 1) * 6 + 16` must be at most 336. Three slots: 160.
Four: 210. Five: 260. Six (five plus Extra slot, the most there ever is): 310. Seven would need
40 unit slots: `7*40 + 6*5 + 16 = 326`.

## 3. Screens

### 3.1 Title

Purpose: get into a level in one tap, reach everything else in two.

**Base layout (content 360 x 600).** The title uses the menu frame (1.6): its tab row is the only
dock part, with Home active. The four small buttons the title used to have (Levels, Stats,
Settings, About) are now tabs in that row.

| Item | Rect (x, y, w, h) | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| Star bank chip | 12, 0, 96, 48 | star icon and the bank total, e.g. "128". Quiet. |
| Buy me a coffee chip | 208, 0, 140, 48 | the chip of 1.7; hidden when the coffee switch is off |
| WoodLogic name | 0, 56, 360, 120 | Display text on a plaque or carved into a plank, graphic designer's call |
| Decorative board | 24, 184, 312, 196 | a few planks and screws, purely decoration, not tappable |
| **Play** | 32, 392, 296, 72 | primary. Label "Play" with the note "Level {n}", or "Back to level" with the note "Level {n}, paused" when a level is paused (1.6), which goes straight into that level. |
| Daily | 32, 472, 144, 56 | secondary. Label "Daily". Note: "Today's puzzle", "Done today", or "Opens after level 8" while locked. |
| Relaxed | 184, 472, 144, 56 | secondary. Label "Relaxed". Note: "No clock", or "Opens after level 8" while locked. |
| Tab row | 12, 540, 336, 52 | Home (active), Map, Stats, Info, Settings, About, see 1.6 |

**Notes under labels:**
- Play note: "Level {n}" where n is the player's next level. A level left unfinished starts
  again from the beginning (section 4.3). When a level is paused (the player went from Pause to
  Settings, About or Info and then to the title), Play reads "Back to level" with "Level {n},
  paused" and goes straight back into that level (play continues, 1.6).
- Daily note: "Today's puzzle" until it is solved today, then "Done today". A solved daily can
  still be replayed (stars only above best, no streak change).
- **Locked Daily and Relaxed.** Both open when level 8 has been cleared `[GDD]`. Before that,
  each button keeps its place but is drawn locked: a padlock icon next to the label, a dimmed
  fill, and the note "Opens after level 8". The note and the padlock stay at full contrast
  (the note carries meaning). The button still answers a tap, so the player is told why: it
  shakes 4 units sideways twice (200 ms) with a dull knock, and the toast says "Clear level 8 to
  open Daily." or "Clear level 8 to open Relaxed." The moment level 8 is cleared, the level clear
  screen shows the unlock note "Unlocked: Daily and Relaxed" (same plaque as theme unlocks).

**Tall (up to 360 x 930):** the buttons and the tab row stay anchored to the bottom of the
content rect. All extra height goes to the name and decorative board: the name block grows by up
to 40, the decoration by up to 200, and the rest becomes space between them. Button sizes do not
change.

**Wide (up to 480):** the button column stays 296 wide, centered. The decoration widens to 360.
The chips stay at the left and right edges of the content rect, and the tab row spans the column.

**First launch:** the title is skipped (section 5). It first shows after level 1 has been
cleared and the player quits to it, or on any later launch.

**Back button:** exits the app. The game is always saved already; nothing asks.

### 3.2 Level

#### 3.2.1 Vertical budget (the numbers the game designer sizes levels against)

Content coordinates, y from the top of the content rect. The content rect is the screen minus
24 top and 16 bottom inset.

**Base: 360 x 640 screen, content rect 360 x 600**

| Band | y from | y to | Height |
|-|-|-|-|
| Top bar (level, timer, star bank, pause) | 0 | 44 | 44 |
| gap | 44 | 48 | 4 |
| Boxes and preview row | 48 | 112 | 64 |
| gap | 112 | 116 | 4 |
| Tray | 116 | 168 | 52 |
| gap | 168 | 176 | 8 |
| **Board panel** | 176 | 536 | **360** |
| gap | 536 | 544 | 8 |
| Helper bar (or tutorial line) | 544 | 600 | 56 |

**Tall: 360 x 800 screen, content rect 360 x 760**

| Band | y from | y to | Height |
|-|-|-|-|
| Top bar | 0 | 48 | 48 |
| gap | 48 | 54 | 6 |
| Boxes and preview row | 54 | 130 | 76 |
| gap | 130 | 136 | 6 |
| Tray | 136 | 192 | 56 |
| gap | 192 | 204 | 12 |
| **Board panel** | 204 | 684 | **480** |
| gap | 684 | 696 | 12 |
| Helper bar (or tutorial line) | 696 | 760 | 64 |

**The board that levels are authored on is fixed.** Level N must be the same for every player,
so the playable board cannot change with the screen.

- **Board core: 344 wide x 360 tall**, at x 8 to 352. Every plank and every screw is placed in
  the core. This is the size to design blueprints against. The geometry and the rules never
  change with the screen; on large screens only the drawn scale of the whole board view changes
  (**board scale b**, section 3.2.1a). All numbers in this section are for b = 1.
- On the base screen the board panel is exactly the core (344 x 360, panel 360 x 360 with 8 side
  margins of back board).
- On a tall phone (width 360, b = 1) the panel is bigger (up to 360 x 480 at 800 and more
  above) and the core sits centered inside it (60 units of extra back board above and below at
  800). The extra back board is where falling planks drop and swinging planks may overshoot; it
  holds no screws.
  Planks may extend outside the core only as drawing (a plank hanging below its screw), never a
  screw.
- **Screw positions** stay inside the inset rectangle 300 x 316 (22 units in from each core
  edge), so a 28 unit head and its shadow stay on the board.
- **Screw head size** is 28 units across (symbol 16). **Touch target** is a circle of radius 24
  (48 across), centered on the screw.
- **Spacing rule (the game designer's stricter rule, decided by Bart):** every pair of screws
  on a board has centers at least **48 units apart**, in every state, including rest poses.
  Screws never move on the board (a plank swings but its screws do not), so this is a fact of
  the level data, checked once, and free screws' targets can never overlap. It also keeps
  ghosts of covered screws readable. At 48 spacing the inset rectangle holds at most 7 columns x
  7 rows = 49 screws (the GDD caps a level at 36 screws and 24 free at the start).
- The core could grow to 344 x 380 only by shrinking the boxes, tray and bars by 20 units in
  total, and that would crowd them. Not recommended; ask first.

**Heights between and beyond.** Let E be the screen height minus 640.
The first 40 units of E are shared by the bars and gaps in proportion to the two tables (top bar
+4, boxes +12, tray +4, helper bar +8, gaps +12). Everything after that goes to the board panel
only. So at 720 the bars have grown by 20 and the panel is 360 tall; at 800 the panel is 480;
at 840 it is 520. Round to whole units.

**Wider screens** (tablets, foldables) use the scaling rule in 3.2.1a instead of these tables.

#### 3.2.1a Scaling on large screens (decided by Bart: the board view scales up)

The board's geometry is the same for everyone (344 x 360 core, same rules, same spacing). On a
large screen the whole board view is drawn bigger, uniformly, to fill the available board panel.
Hit testing is done in core coordinates and then scaled, so touch targets scale with the board:
a free screw's target is a circle of radius 24 x b, and the spacing rule means neighbors never
overlap at any b.

**Inputs.** Wc and Hc are the content rect's width and height in units (viewport minus insets;
not capped at 480). dpu is how many dp one unit covers on this device (1.0 or more on phones;
about 1.4 to 2.2 on tablets because the height sets the scale there). Margin 8 around the board
panel.

**Two scales.**
- **b, the board scale.** Never below 1.0, never above 2.0 (a head 56 across, a target 96).
- **f, the furniture scale.** It sizes the top bar, boxes and preview, tray, helper bar, their
  gaps, their text and their targets. Floor: **f_floor = the larger of 0.7 and 1 / dpu**. The
  second term keeps every target at least 48 dp and every text at least 13 dp even when f is
  below 1. On every phone f_floor is 1.0 or close to it, so phones never shrink their bars.
  Ceiling for the stacked arrangement: 1.167 (the tall phone budget).

**Arrangement 1, stacked** (the phone arrangement: top bar, boxes, tray, board, helper bar, top
to bottom). Always available.
1. b = min( (Wc - 16) / 344, (Hc - 240 x f_floor) / 360 ), kept between 1.0 and 2.0.
2. f = (Hc - 360 x b) / 240, kept between f_floor and 1.167.
3. The board panel is Wc - 16 wide and Hc - 240 x f tall, and the scaled core (344 x b by
   360 x b) sits centered in it. Extra panel is plain back board with no screws.
4. Bars span the panel width. Their contents (boxes, tray, helper buttons) are scaled by f and
   centered; the helper buttons grow wider than 104 x f to fill the width, and are never
   taller than the bar.
For a 360 wide phone this gives b = 1 and f = 1.0 at 640 and the tall tables at 800, as before.

**Arrangement 2, split** (for near square and wider windows). The boxes, tray and helpers move
to a **rail** on the right so the board can use the full height.
1. f = f_floor. Rail width R = 360 x f. Board panel width Pw = Wc - R - 24.
2. b = min( Pw / 344, (Hc - 48 x f - 8 - 8) / 360 ), kept at 2.0 or less. Split is allowed only
   when this b is at least 1.0.
3. The top bar spans the full width at the top (44 x f tall). The board panel is on the left,
   under it, Pw wide and Hc - 48 x f - 8 tall, with the scaled core centered in it. The rail is
   on the right, same height, 8 from the edge.
4. The rail holds, top to bottom, the open boxes (one row), the preview boxes (one row), the
   tray, and the helper bar, all at scale f, centered, with the free space shared evenly
   between the four groups. The helper bar sits at the bottom of the rail, where a thumb
   rests.

**Choosing.** Work out b for both arrangements. Use split only if its b is larger than the
stacked b. Ties go to stacked.

**Overlays are not scaled.** Pause, level clear, out of room, helper sheets and dialogs keep
their size from section 3, are anchored to the bottom, and use the content column of at most
480 over a dimmed level screen.

**Worked examples** (insets 24 top and 16 bottom units on the phones and the foldable, 12 and 8
on the tablets because a unit is larger there).

| Screen | Viewport | Hc | dpu | f_floor | Arrangement | b | f | Board drawn |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Base phone | 360 x 640 | 600 | 1.0 | 1.0 | stacked | 1.00 | 1.00 | 344 x 360 |
| Tall phone | 360 x 800 | 760 | 1.0 | 1.0 | stacked | 1.00 | 1.167 | 344 x 360 in a 360 x 480 panel |
| 10 inch tablet, portrait, 10:16 (1200 x 1920 px) | 400 x 640 | 620 | 2.14 | 0.70 | stacked | 1.12 | 0.91 | 384 x 402 |
| 10 inch tablet, 3:4 | 480 x 640 | 620 | 1.6 | 0.70 | stacked | 1.26 | 0.70 | 432 x 452 in a 464 x 452 panel |
| Unfolded foldable | 840 x 720 | 680 | 1.25 | 0.80 | split | 1.54 | 0.80 | 528 x 553 in a 528 x 634 panel |
| Galaxy Z Fold5 folded (904 x 2316 px) | 360 x 922 | 882 | 1.0 | 1.0 | stacked | 1.00 | 1.167 | 344 x 360 in a 360 x 602 panel (121 units of back board above and below) |
| Galaxy Z Fold5 opened (1812 x 2176 px) | 533 x 640 | 600 | 1.46 | 0.70 | stacked | 1.20 | 0.70 | 413 x 432 in a 517 x 432 panel |

Detail for the 10 inch tablet (400 x 640): b = min(384 / 344 = 1.116, (620 - 168) / 360 =
1.256) = 1.116, so f = (620 - 402) / 240 = 0.91. The bands become top bar 40, boxes 58, tray
47, helper bar 51, gaps 22. The board is 384 x 402 and fills the panel. At 2.14 dp per unit, a
0.91 target is 48 x 0.91 x 2.14 = 93 dp, far above 48 dp. For the 3:4 tablet the bars fall to
f = 0.70 to give the board 1.26, and the 464 wide panel leaves 16 units of back board each side
of the board.

Detail for the unfolded foldable, 840 x 720 (Wc 840, Hc 680, 1.25 dp per unit, so f = 0.80):
- Stacked would give b = min(824 / 344 = 2.40, (680 - 192) / 360 = 1.36) = 1.36, a board 466 x
  488 in the middle of a very wide screen.
- Split gives R = 288, Pw = 528, b = min(528 / 344 = 1.54, (680 - 38 - 16) / 360 = 1.74) = 1.54.
  That is larger, so split is used.
- Layout: top bar 840 x 35. Under it on the left, the board panel 528 x 634 with the core drawn
  528 x 553, 40 units of back board above and below. On the right, the rail 288 x 634 holding
  the open boxes (each 74 x 45), the preview boxes (50 x 35), the tray (5 slots of 35) and
  the helper bar (buttons 83 x 45) spaced evenly down it. A screw head is 43 across and its
  target 74 across. Every rail button is 38 units tall or more, which is 48 dp.
- Under the current stretch settings the engine would report this window shape as 747 x 640
  (the height sets the scale). The same rule gives split with b = 1.36 there, and the same
  proportions.

The graphic designer draws a plain wooden back panel behind the rail and the bars so the split
arrangement looks like one workbench, and the same panel continues behind the top bar.

#### 3.2.2 Bands

**Top bar** (height 44; 48 on tall)

| Item | Rect (x, y, w, h) at base | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| Coffee cup (from level 4, when the coffee switch is on) | 4, 0, 48, 44 | an icon only cup, quiet; target 48 x 48 (grows 4 into the gap below); accessible name "Buy me a coffee"; see 1.7 for why it is here and how it is kept safe |
| Level label | 56, 0, 92, 44 | Heading size 18 bold: "Level {n}" (16 from level 1000 on). For the daily: "Daily". For relaxed: "Relaxed". |
| Timer and pips | 150, 0, 86, 44 | timer "m:ss" (Body 16) and two small pips, see below. Hidden in Relaxed. |
| Star bank | 238, 0, 64, 44 | star icon and the total, e.g. "128". Hidden in Relaxed. |
| Pause button | 308, 0, 48, 44 | target is 48 x 48 (grows 4 into the gap below). Pause icon (two bars). Label for screen readers: "Pause". |

Without the cup (levels 1 to 3, the coffee switch off, or while the clear screen, the out of
room sheet, a sheet or a dialog shows), the bar goes back to the version below, so it never has
an empty gap at the left: the level label is 12, 0, 96, 44 at Heading size 20; the timer and pips
at 112, 0, 108, 44; the star bank at 224, 0, 76, 44; the pause button unchanged. The cup and the
pause button are 256 units apart.

- **Timer** counts up from the first **action** of the attempt, not from when the level
  appears (decided by Bart, GDD S6). An action is a tap that is accepted or a helper use
  (including Get and use). A refused tap (section 6.1) is not an action, and neither is a tap on
  a covered screw. The timer stops while the game is paused, while a helper sheet or the buy
  dialog is open, at the clear and at the loss. It shows "0:00" until the first action and caps
  at "59:59". Retry resets it.
- **Pips.** Two tiny 14 unit icons beside the timer tell the player which bonus stars are still
  possible: a stopwatch pip (speed, filled while the time is within par, outline once past par)
  and a tray pip (clean, filled until the tray is used more than par times or a helper is used,
  then outline). They change shape (filled to outline) in silence, quietly. They are
  information, not alarms. They stay (decided by Bart) and are checked at Gate 1.
- Using Undo, or any helper, turns the clean pip to an outline at once. That is the visible
  cost of a helper (decided by Bart, GDD R32): Undo costs the Clean star.
- The coffee cup is in the top bar from level 4 (decided by Bart, 21 October 2026; 1.7). It also
  has its chip in Pause. It is the only control in the top bar that leaves the app.
- The timer, pips and star bank appear from level 4 `[GDD S9]`. Levels 1 to 3 show only the
  level label and the pause button, so those levels are just the board. Stars are still
  awarded on levels 1 to 3 and shown on the clear screen.

**Boxes and preview row** (64 tall at base, 76 tall at 800)

- **Box layout, settled for the Workshop look** (from docs/design/workshop-boxes.png). Wells on
  top, the color and symbol painted across the front, the lid leaning back above. There is no
  lid strip carrying the symbol. Open boxes `[C:open]`: two boxes, each body 92 x 56, at x 12
  to 104 and x 112 to 204, y 6 to 62 inside the 64 tall row.
  - **Lid:** a thin strip (3 units, in the box's color, drawn y 2 to 6) leaning back above the
    body. Decoration, and it swings forward over the wells when the box closes.
  - **Wells** `[C:slots]`: three hollows of 24 units (x offsets 6, 34, 62 inside the body),
    their centers **20 units below the top of the body** (so y 8 to 32). Empty wells are a
    neutral dark hollow, never the box color, so an empty well cannot be mistaken for a screw. A
    filled well shows the screw drawn 24 across with its symbol.
  - **Front band:** a painted band 80 x 18 at x offset 6, y offset 36 to 54 of the body, in the
    box's color, with its symbol centered. The symbol is 14 units tall with strokes of at least
    2 units, drawn black or white, whichever contrasts more with the band (at least 3 to 1, aim
    for 4.5 to 1).
  - **Usability check:** a 14 unit symbol on the box is a little smaller than the 16 unit drive
    on a screw. That is fine here, because the band is large and its color and the screws
    already sitting in the wells say the same thing. Do not make the band thinner than 18.
  - When symbols are off the symbol is not drawn; the band's color and the box shape stay.
- A small chevron (8 wide) at x 206 to 214 separates open boxes from the queue.
- Preview boxes `[C:prev]`: two closed trays, each 62 x 44, at x 216 to 278 and x 286 to 348,
  vertically centered in the row. Each has a painted lid in the box's color with its symbol at
  20 units, black or white by contrast. They carry no wells. The first preview is the next to
  slide in.
- On tall screens the row height grows to 76 by adding space around the boxes. Their widths do
  not change, because the row is already full.

**Tray** (52 tall at base, 56 at 800)

- **Slots by level `[C:tray]` (decided by Bart, 22 October 2026).** The tray shrinks to make
  play harder. The number of slots belongs to the level, so a replay from the map has the
  size that level had:

| Where | Slots |
|-|-|
| Tutorial levels 1 to 8 | 5 |
| Levels 9 to 11 | 5 |
| Levels 12 to 20 | 4 |
| Levels 21 and up | 3 |
| Daily | 3 |
| Relaxed | 5 `[GDD: the game designer is deciding]` |
| After using Extra slot | one more than the level's number, for the rest of that try |

- **Layout for each size.** Each slot is 44 x 44 with 6 between, in a frame with 8 units of
  padding at each end, 52 tall, centered in the content column (x is for a 360 wide content
  rect). The frame is the brushed steel parts tray with riveted ends, so a smaller tray is a
  shorter steel tray, never a stretched one. Each slot is a neutral hollow of 38 units; a screw
  in it is drawn 32 units across with its symbol. The box row above (92 wide open boxes, 62 wide
  previews) and every touch target are unchanged at every tray size.

| Slots | Frame width | Frame x range | Slot left edges (x) |
|-|-|-|-|
| 3 | 160 | 100 to 260 | 108, 158, 208 |
| 4 | 210 | 75 to 285 | 83, 133, 183, 233 |
| 5 | 260 | 50 to 310 | 58, 108, 158, 208, 258 |
| 6 (5 plus Extra slot) | 310 | 25 to 335 | 33, 83, 133, 183, 233, 283 |
| 5 (4 plus Extra slot) | 260 | 50 to 310 | as the 5 row |
| 4 (3 plus Extra slot) | 210 | 75 to 285 | as the 4 row |

  On phones the widest tray (310) fits the 336 unit column with 13 units spare each side. On
  tablets and in the split arrangement (3.2.1a) the whole tray scales with f like the other bars
  and stays centered in the bar or the rail; it never needs more width than 310 x f.
- Filling order: leftmost free slot first. Slots never rearrange themselves (GDD).
- **Extra slot** widens the frame by 50, keeping it centered: the existing slots slide left by
  25 (250 ms, ease out, screws travel with their slots, order unchanged) and the new slot grows
  in at the right end. Retry gives back the level's normal size.
- **Warning at one free slot `[C:tray]`:** when exactly one slot is free, the frame turns a warm
  warning tone and a small triangle with an exclamation mark is drawn inside the free slot
  (a symbol, so it is not only color). One soft tick sound plays as the state is entered, and no
  more often than once every 2 seconds. There is no looping animation. If a screw leaves the
  tray (a box opens and takes it) and two slots are free again, the warning clears without
  sound.
  - **Is "one left" still right on a 3 slot tray? Yes, for every size.** The warning means "the
    next screw that goes to the tray is the last one it can take", and that is true whatever the
    size. On a 3 slot tray it shows after two screws wait in the tray, which is simply how tight
    that tray is. It stays a steady, quiet state with one soft tick, so it cannot become
    nagging, and it follows the tray as it is now, so Extra slot clears it (the free count goes
    from one to two).
- **The shrink line (once only).** The first time the player plays a numbered level whose tray is
  smaller than the 5 slots they started with (level 12 on the normal path), one short line shows:
  "The tray is smaller now. Every slot counts."
  - **Wording:** exactly that text, Tutorial line style (18 bold, or 16 if it wraps to two
    lines) on the same 336 x 48 plaque as the tutorial lines.
  - **Placement:** in the helper bar position, in place of the helper buttons for a short time
    (the board and the tray are never covered). The helper bar fades back afterwards. A steady
    3 unit outline around the tray frame shows for the same time (fades in and out over 150 ms
    each, no pulsing).
  - **Timing:** it appears when the board has settled (after the planks have dropped). It stays
    at least 2.5 seconds and at most 6, and leaves at the player's first action after the 2.5
    seconds (or at 6 seconds). The line itself never starts the clock and never needs a tap.
  - **Once:** it is never shown again for this player (the save keeps one flag), not on Retry, a
    replay, the daily or Relaxed. A progress reset shows it again, like the helper sheets.
  - **The tray closing:** when the player arrives by Next from level 11 (or from level 20 to 21),
    the new board slides in with the tray at the old size, then the extra slot closes (the
    frame's end slides in over 300 ms, a dull wood knock, and the frame re-centers). On level 21
    no line is shown, only the closing. From the title or the map the tray simply appears at its
    new size.
- **Full tray:** all slots filled. If any free screw can still go to an open box, play
  continues. The tray frame holds the warning tone with a closed-lid icon in the frame corner.
  A tap on a free screw that has nowhere to go is refused (section 6.1, rule R25).

**Board panel.** The board art and screws. Free screws look raised with a rim and a shadow.
Covered screws show faintly through the wood: drawn flat, about 45 percent opacity, with a
dashed ring and no shadow, so free and covered differ by opacity, shading, outline style and
shadow, never by color alone. Covered screws keep their color and symbol so the player sees
what is under what.

**Helper bar** (56 tall at base, 64 at 800)

- Three buttons, each 104 x 56, with 12 between, filling 336 of width. Each shows an icon (28),
  the helper name below it (Caption 13) and a count badge (24 unit circle with the number, Body
  16 bold) at the top right corner. Names: "Undo", "Extra slot", "Screwdriver".
- A helper that has not been introduced yet is not shown. The bar then shows the tutorial line
  of that level, if there is one, in a 336 x 48 plaque (Tutorial line style, centered, up to
  two lines at 16 if needed).
- **Owned (count 1 or more):** a tap uses one.
  - Undo: takes back the last action (a tap or a Screwdriver removal) at once. It can be used
    again and again back to the start of the try, each use spending one Undo `[GDD R26 to
    R28]`. With nothing to take back it does nothing, spends nothing, and shows the toast
    "Nothing to undo."
  - Extra slot: adds one tray slot for the rest of this try, once per try `[GDD R30]`. After it
    is used the button shows "Used" in place of the count and is disabled. Retry gives back the
    level's normal tray size.
  - Screwdriver: enters a mode. A banner replaces the helper bar: "Tap any screw to remove it."
    with a Cancel button (96 x 48 at the right). The next tap on any screw, covered or free,
    removes it. Cancel, the system back button, or tapping the pause button leaves the mode and
    keeps the helper. If the chosen screw has nowhere to go (no open box of its color with room
    and a full tray) the removal is refused and the Screwdriver is not spent: the screw shakes
    back (as in 6.1), the mode stays, and the toast says "That screw has nowhere to go."

- **Not owned (count 0):** the badge shows the price instead, with a small star icon (for
  example "3" and a star for Undo, "5" for Extra slot, "8" for Screwdriver `[GDD]`). A tap opens the buy dialog (3.13.3) if the bank can pay. If it
  cannot, the button looks dimmed and a tap shows the toast "Not enough stars. {price} needed."
- **Relaxed (decided by Bart):** the bar shows only the free Undo, centered, with no count. Its
  badge reads "Free" and it never runs out. Extra slot and Screwdriver are hidden, and the buy
  dialog never appears.

#### 3.2.3 States of the level screen

- **Playing.** Everything above.
- **Hand hint.** Tutorial levels may show a pointing hand (section 5).
- **Helper intro.** A sheet over the lower board with the first-time explanation (3.13).
- **Screwdriver mode.** Banner described above. Free and covered screws all show their symbol
  bright, so the player can pick any.
- **Paused.** The pause screen (3.3).
- **Cleared.** The clear screen (3.4) takes over.
- **Out of room.** The sheet from 3.5 slides up.

**Back button:** opens Pause. In Screwdriver mode it leaves the mode first. In the helper intro
it closes the intro. In a dialog it closes the dialog.

### 3.3 Pause

Purpose: stop the clock, change sound, leave. Reached from the pause button, the Android back
button, or automatically when the app loses focus.

- The board is covered by the pause panel, not only dimmed, so thinking time during a pause does
  not help the speed star. The timer is stopped.
- Full screen panel, content rect 360 x 600:

| Item | Rect (x, y, w, h) | Label |
|-|-|-|
| Buy me a coffee chip | 208, 0, 140, 48 | the chip of 1.7 with its words, same place as on the other screens; absent when the coffee switch is off. The level's top bar also has the cup. |
| Heading | 0, 96, 360, 36 | "Paused" |
| Level line | 0, 140, 360, 24 | "Level {n}" (or "Daily" or "Relaxed, {Easy, Medium or Hard}") |
| **Resume** | 32, 300, 296, 72 | "Resume" (primary) |
| Retry | 32, 380, 296, 52 | "Retry" |
| Sound | 32, 440, 144, 52 | "Sound: On" or "Sound: Off", with a speaker icon (crossed out when off) |
| Music | 184, 440, 144, 52 | "Music: On" or "Music: Off", with a note icon (crossed out when off) |
| Settings | 32, 500, 144, 52 | "Settings" (decided by Bart, below) |
| Quit to title | 184, 500, 144, 52 | "Quit to title" |

- Sound and Music toggle at once on tap and the label changes in the same frame.
- Retry restarts the same level at once with no question (Retry is always free). The timer
  resets, the tray goes back to its start size, and helpers already spent stay spent `[GDD
  R34]`.
- Quit to title shows the title. The level is not kept: Play starts it again from the beginning
  (section 4.3).
- **Settings from Pause (decided by Bart, 21 October 2026): one tap from Pause.** I put it in
  Pause and not in the top bar because the top bar is full and the pause button is the one
  control up there near the thumb, and Pause already holds the sound and music switches. It
  costs two taps from play (Pause, Settings). Settings opens with the nav dock (1.6) showing "Back to level",
  so the player can also visit About or Info and still get back. The level stays paused in
  memory, nothing is lost (not the clock, the tray, the helpers spent or the board), and the
  player returns to this Pause screen with the Android back button, or straight into the level
  with "Back to level" (1.6). Changes made in Settings (sound, music, symbols, wood, metal) are
  in effect when the player resumes.
- **Tall:** the heading and level line stay at the same distance from the top; the buttons stay
  anchored to the bottom.
- **Back button:** same as Resume.

### 3.4 Level clear

Purpose: celebrate fast, then get out of the way. Next is one tap.

**Timeline (all within 1.6 seconds, none of it blocks input):**

| Time from the last screw landing | Event |
|-|-|
| 0 ms | the box closes; the board is empty or its last planks fall |
| 250 ms | the heading drops in (150 ms), chime begins |
| 350 ms | star 1 pops (200 ms, ease out with a small overshoot), rising chime note |
| 650 ms | star 2 pops, or its outline settles if not earned |
| 950 ms | star 3 pops, or its outline settles if not earned |
| 1600 ms | particles finish; everything is at rest |

Next and Replay fade in from 350 ms and are tappable from **500 ms**, before the stars finish.

A tap on Next during the celebration skips the rest and loads the next level. The result is
already saved at the moment of the clear, so it can never be lost by skipping.

**Layout (content 360 x 600):**

| Item | Rect (x, y, w, h) | Text |
|-|-|-|
| Heading | 0, 56, 360, 36 | "Level {n} cleared" |
| Star row | 48, 120, 264, 72 | three stars 72 across with 24 between |
| Star captions | 30, 200, 300, 72 | three columns of 100: label (Button 18) then detail (Caption 13) |
| Summary line | 32, 284, 296, 28 | "+{k} stars" or "No new stars this time" (Heading 20) |
| Unlock note (when any) | 32, 322, 296, 48 | "Unlocked: {name} wood" or "Unlocked: {name} metal" |
| Gift note (when due) | 32, 322, 296, 48 (or 32, 374, 296, 48 under an unlock note) | "A gift for reaching level {n}: 2 Undos and 1 Extra slot." |
| **Next** | 32, 460, 296, 72 | "Next" with a right arrow, note "Level {n+1}" (primary) |
| Replay | 32, 540, 296, 48 | "Replay" (secondary) |

Captions per star (label then detail; the target is always shown, whether earned or not, so the
player learns what to aim for):

| Star | Label | Detail |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | "Cleared" | "Every screw is out" |
| 2 | "Fast" | "Within {par_time}" (for example "Within 1:20") and, when earned, the player's time below it: "Yours {time}" |
| 3 | "Clean" | "Tray {par} times or fewer, no helpers" for par 2 or more; "Tray once or never, no helpers" for par 1; "No tray, no helpers" for par 0 |

- Earned stars are filled and warm; not earned stars are outline only with a faint inner mark,
  so the difference is shape and not only color.
- "+{k} stars" counts only stars above the player's best for this level. For one star: "+1 star".
  A replay with no gain: "No new stars this time".
- The star bank in the corner is not on this screen; the summary line is the confirmation.
- Unlock note shows only when this clear passes a theme milestone `[GDD]`. It is a plaque, not a
  dialog, and does not need a tap.
- **Gift note (decided by Bart, 22 October 2026).** Reaching level 50, and again level 100,
  gives 2 Undos and 1 Extra slot. It is shown on the level clear screen, in the same quiet way as
  the unlock note, so Next stays one tap. See 3.13.4.
- **Daily clear:** heading "Daily puzzle solved". The summary line is followed by "Streak: {n}
  days" (or "Streak: 1 day"). The big button reads "Done" and goes to the title. Replay stays.
- **Relaxed clear:** no stars, no timing. Heading "Nicely done". The big button reads "Another"
  (a new relaxed level at the same difficulty). The second button reads "Done" and goes to the
  title.
- **Tall:** the heading, stars and captions move down in proportion (heading at 15 percent of the
  height, stars at 22 percent). Buttons stay anchored to the bottom.
- **Back button:** goes to the title. The clear is already saved.

### 3.5 Out of room (the loss)

Purpose: say plainly what happened, and get back to playing in under two seconds.

**When it appears.** The losing tap's screw lands in the tray (about 400 ms). The tray slots
shake 6 units sideways for 250 ms and the soft falling tone plays. A beat of 300 ms lets the
player see the full tray. Then the sheet slides up (250 ms). So the sheet is up about 0.9 seconds
after the tap, Retry works from the first frame of the slide, and the level restarts within 400
ms of the Retry tap (the level data is kept in memory, so there is never a wait to generate).

**Layout (content 360 x 600).** The sheet has two heights. With at least one helper owned it is
360 x 300 at y 300; with none owned it is 360 x 244 at y 356. Rects are inside the sheet.

| Item | Rect inside the sheet (x, y, w, h) | Text |
|-|-|-|
| Heading | 32, 16, 296, 32 | "The tray is full" |
| Body | 32, 48, 296, 44 | "Every slot is taken, and no free screw fits an open box." |
| **Retry** | 32, 100, 296, 64 | "Retry" (primary) |
| Helper row (only when at least one helper can be offered) | 32, 172, 296, 56 | 1 to 3 buttons, see below |
| Bottom button | 32, 236, 296, 48 (or 32, 172, 296, 48 with no helper row) | "Previous level" (or "Title", see below), quiet |

- **Decided by Bart, GDD R37:** the sheet offers each helper the player owns **and can use**,
  and never offers to buy one. A helper with count 0 is not shown, and neither is one that
  cannot be used right now (not dimmed, not greyed: simply absent). Nothing on this sheet
  costs stars.
- **Which buttons appear**, in this fixed order left to right:
  1. "Undo ({n})" when the Undo count is 1 or more.
  2. "Extra slot ({n})" when its count is 1 or more and it has not been used in this try.
  3. "Screwdriver ({n})" when its count is 1 or more and at least one screw on the board,
     covered or not, fits an open box (GDD R37). The engine reports this from the state.
- **Layout for 0 to 3 buttons** (the row is 296 wide and 56 tall, 8 between buttons, always
  filling the full width so the row never looks lopsided):

| Buttons | Sheet | Row contents |
|-|-|-|
| 0 | 360 x 244 at y 356, no helper row | Retry at y 100, bottom button at y 172 |
| 1 | 360 x 300 at y 300 | one button 296 x 56, laid out as a row: icon (28), name (Button 18), count badge at the right |
| 2 | 360 x 300 at y 300 | two buttons 144 x 56 each, icon above name, count badge at the top right corner |
| 3 | 360 x 300 at y 300 | three buttons 93 x 56 each (296 minus 16, divided by 3), icon above name (Caption 13, "Screwdriver" fits), count badge at the top right corner |

  Retry is always the biggest button and sits first, above the row, so it is the first thing
  the thumb finds. All helper buttons are at least 48 tall and at least 93 wide, so every target
  meets the 48 unit rule.
- **What each button does.** It uses one helper, closes the sheet, and play continues. The clock
  restarts from where it stopped (GDD R37).
  - Undo takes back the last action `[GDD R29]`.
  - Extra slot adds the sixth tray slot, so the tray is no longer full.
  - Screwdriver enters the Screwdriver mode (banner on the helper bar, section 3.2.2). After a
    loss no free screw can go anywhere, so the screws it can help with are covered ones that fit
    an open box.
  Using any helper costs this try's Clean star (the clean pip turns to an outline).
- The board stays visible above the sheet, dimmed by 30 percent only, so the player can see
  how the tray filled. The tray frame stays at full brightness above the sheet. The board shows
  down to y 300 (or 356 without helpers).
- "Previous level" loads level n minus 1 and is not shown on level 1 or in the daily. In those
  cases the bottom button is "Title".
- **Relaxed stuck sheet** (relaxed levels cannot be lost): the 244 tall sheet with heading
  "Stuck for now", body "Nothing fits an open box and the tray is full. Take back a move and try
  another way." and buttons: "Undo" (primary, free, 64 tall, in the place of Retry), then
  "Retry" and "Title" side by side (144 wide each) in the place of the bottom button. No other
  helpers are offered.
- **Tall:** the sheet keeps its size and stays anchored to the bottom; the board shows more.
- **Back button:** goes to the title (the level can be continued with Play: it restarts from the
  beginning).

### 3.6 Progress map (replaces the plain levels list; decided by Bart, 21 October 2026)

Purpose: show the trail of cleared levels with their stars, replay any of them to earn more
stars, and start the next one. It is the "Map" tab of the dock.

**Layout (content 360 x 600).** The menu frame (1.6): header "Progress map" with the coffee chip,
a body that is the trail (y 56 to 472, 416 tall at base, more on tall screens), the game row
and the tab row.

**The trail.** A vertical trail of nodes, level 1 at the bottom and higher levels above, so the
player scrolls up as they progress and the next level sits in the middle.
- **Node centers.** Level N is at y = Y(1) minus (N - 1) x 88 (88 units between centers). Its x
  centre follows a zigzag over three lanes (x 84, 180, 276 in a 360 wide column; the lanes
  follow the column center on wider screens, spacing 96): lane x for level N is
  `[180, 276, 180, 84][(N - 1) mod 4]`. Nodes never come closer than 130 units to one another.
- **Node sizes (touch targets at least their size, all at least 48):**

| Node | Size | Shows |
|-|-|-|
| Cleared | 64 x 64 badge | the level number (Button 18) and three stars (12 units each), filled or outline |
| Hard level (every 5th level from 10 on: 10, 15, 20 ...) | 72 x 72 badge with a notched edge | the same, a little larger, so the sawtooth is visible (the GDD's hard levels) |
| Next | 80 x 80 brass badge | the level number and a play triangle, with a thick border |
| Locked | 64 x 64 dimmed badge | the level number and a padlock icon in place of the stars |

  The states differ in shape and icons, not only color: the stars (filled or outline), the
  play triangle, the padlock, the larger size and the border. The number is always shown at full
  contrast (4.5 to 1).
- **Connectors.** A path joins each node to the next: solid between cleared nodes and up to the
  next node, dashed beyond it (a shape difference). The look is the graphic designer's.
- **What is on the map.** All cleared levels (1 to H), the next level (H + 1, the one the player
  has not cleared yet) and **4 locked levels** beyond it (H + 2 to H + 5). The trail fades out
  over the top 64 units of the body above the last locked node, and there is nothing after it.
  There are no gaps and no skipping, because levels are cleared in order.
- **Opens centered on the next level.** On opening, the scroll position puts the center of the
  next node at the vertical center of the body. At the start of the trail there is half a
  screen of empty back board below level 1, so even level 1 can be centered. Every new visit
  starts there; the position is not remembered.
- **Scrolling.** A vertical drag with momentum (friction so a fast flick travels about 1500
  units), clamped softly at both ends. A touch that moves under 10 units and lasts under 300 ms
  is a tap; more is a scroll. The pressed look shows on touch down and is dropped if the touch
  turns into a scroll.
- **Tapping a node:**
  - **Cleared:** starts that level as a replay at once, with no confirmation (stars only above
    the best are earned). A level that was paused is dropped (section 4.1).
  - **Next:** starts it.
  - **Locked:** nothing starts. The node nudges 4 units sideways twice (200 ms), the dull knock
    plays, and the toast says "Clear level {n} first." where n is the next level (the one the
    player has to clear), not the neighboring node.
- **"Go to level" chip.** When the next node is more than half a body height out of view, a quiet
  chip, 140 x 48, sits at the bottom center of the body with an arrow (up or down toward the
  node) and the text "Go to level {n}". A tap scrolls to it (400 ms, ease out) and the chip goes
  away. It is a control that waits to be tapped; it never moves or blinks.
- **Smooth with hundreds of levels (required).** Level node positions come from the formulas
  above, so nothing is built per level. Only the nodes in view plus 3 above and below exist (a
  pool of about 20), or they are drawn by one custom drawing control that skips what is off
  screen. The content height is computed (about 88 per level), not stored in a huge picture. A tap
  is turned into a level number by arithmetic. It holds 60 fps with 1000 levels. Star counts come
  from the save (best stars per level). Opening takes one frame, whatever the level.
- **Empty state:** a player who has cleared nothing sees level 1 as the next node and 4 locked
  nodes. No other text.
- **Screen readers:** each node's label reads "Level {n}, {k} stars", "Level {n}, next" or
  "Level {n}, locked".
- **Tall:** the body is taller, so more nodes show. **Wide:** the trail stays centered in the
  column of at most 480; node sizes do not change.
- **Back button:** goes back to where the player came from (Title, or Pause), section 4.2.

### 3.7 Stats

Purpose: show the player's record. Kept on the phone only.

**Layout (content 360 x 600):** the menu frame (1.6): header "Stats" (Heading) with the coffee
chip, a vertical scroll area at y 56 to 472, the game row and the tab row.

Rows are 48 tall plaques: label on the left (Body 16), value on the right (Button 18, bold).

| Group | Label | Value |
|-|-|-|
| Levels | "Levels cleared" | number |
| | "Highest level" | number |
| | "Total stars" | number (stars earned in all) |
| | "Three-star levels" | number |
| Daily puzzle | "Current streak" | "{n} days" or "1 day" or "0 days" |
| | "Best streak" | "{n} days" |
| | "Daily puzzles solved" | number |
| Helpers | "Helpers used" | number |
| Times | group heading "Times by difficulty" | |
| | column headings "Band", "Best", "Average" | |
| | one row per band: "Easy", "Medium", "Hard", "Expert" `[GDD 6.7]` | best and average as "m:ss", or "None yet" |

- Group headings are Button 18 on a slim plaque.
- The daily counts in "Medium". Tutorial levels and Relaxed are not timed.
- A footer line in Small: "These numbers stay on this phone."
- Numbers of 1000 or more use a comma ("1,234").
- **Empty state:** zero values show as "0", times as "None yet", and a line at the top reads
  "Play a few levels and your numbers show up here."
- **Back button:** goes back to where the player came from (Title, or Pause), section 4.2.

### 3.8 Settings

Purpose: sound, music, symbols, themes, reset. Nothing else.

**Layout (content 360 x 600):** the menu frame (1.6): header "Settings" with the coffee chip, a
scroll area y 56 to 472, the game row and the tab row. Rows (heights are minimum, 8 between).
Settings opens from the title's tab row, from any other tab, and from Pause (3.3), where the dock
shows "Back to level":

| Row | Height | Contents |
|-|-|-|
| Sound | 56 | toggle row, label "Sound", note "Taps, clinks and wood knocks" |
| Music | 56 | toggle row, label "Music", note "Quiet background tones" |
| Colorblind symbols | 64 | toggle row, label "Colorblind symbols", note "A shape on every screw and box" |
| Wood | 104 | label "Wood"; five swatches 48 x 48 with 8 between (272 wide); a caption line under them |
| Metal | 104 | label "Metal"; up to five swatches as above; a caption line |
| Reset progress | 56 | danger styled row, label "Reset progress", note "Erase levels, stars, helpers and stats" |

- Defaults: Sound On, Music On, Colorblind symbols **On**. Toggles apply in the same frame and
  are saved at once.
- **Pickers.** Each swatch is a 48 x 48 target that shows the wood grain or the screw metal as a
  small sample. The selected one has a thick outline and a check mark (two signals). A locked
  one is dimmed and shows a padlock icon. The caption line under the strip names the swatch
  last touched:
  - Selected and free: "{name}" (for example "Oak").
  - Locked by level: "{name}. Clear level {n} to unlock." Locked by streak: "{name}. Reach a {n}
    day daily streak to unlock." The numbers are the GDD's (section 7): Walnut 10, Maple 50,
    Cherry 100, Ebony 150 (levels), Brass 25 (level), Copper 3 and Black 7 (best daily streak,
    so a broken streak never takes anything away). Oak and Steel are open from the start.
  - Tapping a locked swatch only shows the caption; it does not change the theme.
  - Wood names: "Oak", "Walnut", "Maple", "Cherry", "Ebony". Metal names: "Steel", "Brass",
    "Copper", "Black". (The Workshop direction proposes nine screw colors, but metals are the
    four finishes above.)
- **Reset progress** opens a dialog:
  - Heading: "Erase everything?"
  - Body: "This erases your levels, stars, helpers, streaks and stats on this phone. It cannot be
    undone. Your settings stay as they are."
  - Buttons, stacked, in the bottom half of the dialog: "Keep my progress" (primary, 304 wide
    minus margins, listed first and focused) and below it, 16 units apart, "Erase everything"
    (danger).
  - If a level is paused (Settings was opened from Pause), the dialog adds one sentence to the
    body: "The level you paused ends too."
  - After erasing: a toast "Progress erased." The next Play starts level 1 and skips the title
    like a first launch. A paused level is gone, so the game row reads "Play" and "Level 1".
  - Back button inside the dialog: same as "Keep my progress".
- **Tall:** the scroll area grows; no row changes size.
- **Back button:** goes back to where the player came from: Pause if they opened Settings from
  Pause, otherwise the title (section 4.2).

### 3.9 About

Purpose: what this is, who made it, the links, the fixed statements, License and Credits.

**Layout (content 360 x 600):** the menu frame (1.6): header "About" (no coffee chip, the
Supporting block below is its coffee button), a scroll area y 56 to 472, the game row and the tab
row. Contents in order, 12 between blocks:

1. **What it is.** Block with the name "WoodLogic" (Heading), "Version {version}" (Small), and
   this text (Body):
   "WoodLogic is a free screw puzzle. It was made by Play, Inc. and designed by Bart Basi."
2. **Send feedback** (row button 336 x 64). Label "Send feedback". Note: "Opens a draft in your
   email app. You can edit it first."
3. **Source code** (row button 336 x 64). Label "Source code". Note: "Opens
   github.com/bartbasi/WoodLogic in your browser."
4. **Supporting WoodLogic.** Heading "Supporting WoodLogic" (Button 18), then this fixed text
   (Body):
   "WoodLogic is free, with no ads and no tracking, and it always will be. If you'd like to
   support more games like it, you can buy me a coffee. Never expected, always appreciated."
   Below it the button "Buy me a coffee" (336 x 56, secondary, cup icon drawn in code), with the
   note "Opens a web page in your browser." If the coffee switch is off (1.7), this whole block
   is not shown.
5. **Privacy.** Heading "Privacy", then this fixed text (Body), or its store build wording when
   the coffee switch is off (1.7, needs Bart's approval):
   "WoodLogic collects nothing: no ads, no tracking, no internet. The Buy me a coffee button
   only opens a web page in your phone's browser, and the game itself sends nothing."
6. **License** (row button 336 x 56), label "License", opens 3.10.
7. **Credits** (row button 336 x 56), label "Credits", opens 3.11.
8. **Attribution** (Small, centered, the fixed line):
   "Based on WoodLogic, designed and written by Bart Basi, with assistance from Claude.
   Copyright 2026 Play, Inc."

- **The email draft.** Opens `mailto:bartbasi@gmail.com` with:
  - Subject: "WoodLogic feedback"
  - Body: a blank area for the player's message, then a last line:
    "Sent from WoodLogic {version} on {phone model}, {OS name and version}. You can edit or
    delete this line."
  The draft is shown by the phone's email app; the player can change any part.
- **If a link cannot open:** a toast. For email: "No email app found. You can write to
  bartbasi@gmail.com." For web pages: "No browser found on this phone."
- Links open only the three fixed addresses; nothing the player types is ever passed to them.
- **Wide:** the column stays at most 480.
- **Back button:** goes back to where the player came from (Title, or Pause), section 4.2.

### 3.10 License page

Reached from About. The menu frame (1.6) without a coffee chip: header "License" (Heading), a
scroll area y 56 to 472, the game row and the tab row (About active). Text is Small (14) on a
plaque, with line spacing 1.4, in this order:

1. The attribution line (Body, the fixed line).
2. "WoodLogic is free software. You can use it, study it, share it and change it under the GNU
   General Public License version 3, with a few added terms. The added terms ask you to keep the
   line above, to mark changed versions as changed, and not to present them as the original or
   as made or endorsed by Play, Inc. or Bart Basi. They give no rights to the name WoodLogic or
   its icon."
3. Heading "Additional terms", then the text of the NOTICE file, unchanged.
4. Heading "GNU General Public License, version 3", then the text of the LICENSE file,
   unchanged.

The text of items 3 and 4 comes from the files shipped with the game so it can never drift
from the repository. **Back button:** returns to About (so does the About tab).

### 3.11 Credits page

Reached from About. The menu frame (1.6) without a coffee chip: header "Credits", a scroll
area, the game row and the tab row (About active). Order:

1. "WoodLogic is made with the Godot Engine, a free and open source game engine." (Body)
2. "Every picture and sound in WoodLogic is made by the game's own code." (Body)
3. Heading "Godot Engine".
4. The engine's own license text and its list of third-party parts and their notices, as the
   engine provides them at run time (the engine's license text, copyright information and
   donor list functions, as the platform allows). This is the engine's wording and is shown
   unchanged. It includes the notice for Godot's default font.
5. The attribution line from 3.9 (Small).

**Back button:** returns to About (so does the About tab).

### 3.12 Relaxed setup

Purpose: pick a difficulty and be playing in one tap.

**Layout (content 360 x 600).** The menu frame (1.6) with the coffee chip and the tab row (Home
active), and no game row, because the three buttons below start a game.

| Item | Rect (x, y, w, h) | Text |
|-|-|-|
| Heading | 0, 0, 360, 56 | "Relaxed" (the header) |
| Body | 32, 68, 296, 72 | "No clock, no stars, and you can't lose. Undo is free." |
| **Easy** | 32, 332, 296, 60 | "Easy" and note "Fewer screws, plenty of room" |
| **Medium** | 32, 400, 296, 60 | "Medium" and note "A good puzzle" |
| **Hard** | 32, 468, 296, 60 | "Hard" and note "Tight spots and long plans" |
| Tab row | 12, 540, 336, 52 | see 1.6 |

- A tap on a difficulty starts a relaxed level of that difficulty at once. The last difficulty
  played shows the word "Last" in a small tag at the top right of its button (a tag, not only a
  color).
- Relaxed earns no stars and does not move the main level count.
- **Back button:** goes to the title.

### 3.13 Helper explanations and the buy dialog

#### 3.13.1 First-time explanation

Appears the first time a helper is available, at the levels the GDD sets: **Undo on level 8,
Extra slot on level 15, Screwdriver on level 25** (two free of each, price 3, 5 and 8 stars). It
is a sheet shown when that level appears, before the player's first tap. The timer has not
started and stays stopped while the sheet is open.
The helper bar is visible below the sheet with the new helper's button outlined by a steady ring
(no pulsing) and a down arrow from the sheet to it.

**Layout (content 360 x 600; sheet 360 x 264, y 280 to 544, directly above the helper bar):**

| Item | Rect inside the sheet | Text |
|-|-|-|
| Illustration | 32, 16, 72, 72 | a small animation drawn in code, one loop of about 2 seconds, no flashing |
| Heading | 116, 16, 212, 32 | the helper name (Heading 24) |
| Body | 32, 96, 296, 66 | the explanation (Body 16, up to three lines) |
| Cost note | 32, 166, 296, 20 | "Using a helper means no Clean star on that try." (Small 14) |
| **Got it** | 32, 192, 296, 56 | "Got it" (primary) |

The three explanations:

| Helper | Heading | Body | Illustration |
|-|-|-|-|
| Undo | "Undo" | "Takes back your last move. Here are 2 to get you started." | a screw flies out of a box back onto its plank |
| Extra slot | "Extra slot" | "Adds one more tray slot, once per try. Here are 2 to get you started." | the tray grows one slot on the right |
| Screwdriver | "Screwdriver" | "Removes any one screw, even a covered one, to where a tap would send it. Here are 2 to get you started." | a screwdriver lifts a screw out from under a plank |

- "Got it" closes the sheet; the helper's count badge counts up from 0 to 2 (one tick each,
  200 ms apart), then play starts. The sheet never appears again for that helper.
- A full progress reset shows the explanations again.
- On the base screen the sheet (y 280 to 544) covers the lower part of the board panel. That is
  fine because the player dismisses it before play begins, and the timer has not started.
- **Back button:** same as "Got it".

#### 3.13.2 Level that introduces a helper

Only level 8 (Undo) is a tutorial level with a line: "Tapped the wrong one? Try Undo." The
sheet carries the explanation, and they never both appear at once: the line shows after "Got it"
is tapped. Levels 15 and 25 have no tutorial line; the sheet alone introduces Extra slot and
Screwdriver.

#### 3.13.3 Buy dialog (from a helper button at count 0)

Shown when the player taps a helper they do not own and the bank can pay.

- Decided by Bart: a tap on a helper at count 0 offers "Get and use" for stars, and it happens
  only on the player's own tap. The game never opens this dialog by itself.
- Heading: "Get {name}?" (for example "Get Undo?")
- Body: "{name} costs {price} stars. You have {bank}. Spend {price} and use it now?"
- Buttons: "Get and use" (primary) and "Not now" (secondary). Both 296 wide, 8 apart, in the
  bottom half of the dialog.
- "Get and use" spends the stars, adds one helper and uses it at once. Screwdriver then enters
  its mode; if the player cancels the mode, the helper stays owned.
- The timer stays stopped while the dialog is open. Using the helper after "Get and use" is the
  attempt's first action if nothing came before it, so it starts the timer.
- Never shown in Relaxed. Never shown outside the level screen. Never shown on the out of room
  sheet (3.5).
- **Back button:** same as "Not now".

### 3.14 Info (How to play) (decided by Bart, 21 October 2026)

Bart asked for an "Info" screen. This is the reading I took: How to play, with the rules in a few
short lines, what each helper does, and how stars are earned, reachable from the "Info" tab. It
is marked in section 11 for Bart to confirm.

**Layout (content 360 x 600).** The menu frame (1.6): header "How to play" with the coffee chip, a
scroll area y 56 to 472, the game row and the tab row (Info active). The body is a list of
plaques, 12 between, each 336 wide: a group heading (Button 18) then short entries (Body 16, up
to three lines each, with a small icon of 28 units at the left of helper and star entries). It
has no pictures beyond those icons and nothing animates. It is reading material, and it is never
shown by itself: the tutorial teaches by doing, and this is where a player looks it up again.

**Words, word for word.**

Group "The basics":
1. "Tap a free screw to unscrew it."
2. "It flies into an open box of its color. If no open box fits, it waits in the tray."
3. "The tray starts with 5 slots. It shrinks to 4 from level 12 and to 3 from level 21."
4. "Three screws fill a box. The box leaves and the next one slides in."
5. "A screw under another plank is covered. Free the plank on top first."
6. "A plank with no screws falls. A plank with one screw swings."
7. "Clear every screw to win. If the tray is full and nothing fits, you are out of room. Retry is
   free."

Group "Helpers" (each entry starts with its icon):
1. "Undo. Takes back your last move. Two free on level 8."
2. "Extra slot. Adds one more tray slot, once per try. Two free on level 15."
3. "Screwdriver. Removes any one screw, even a covered one, to where a tap would send it. Two free on level 25."
4. "A Screwdriver is not spent if the screw has nowhere to go."
5. "Out of a helper? Tap it in a level to buy one with stars: Undo 3, Extra slot 5, Screwdriver 8."
6. "Reach level 50 and level 100 for a gift each time: 2 Undos and 1 Extra slot."
7. "Using a helper means no Clean star on that try."

Group "Stars" (each entry starts with a filled star icon):
1. "Cleared. Finish the level."
2. "Fast. Finish within the par time."
3. "Clean. Use the tray no more than the par number of times, with no helpers."
4. "Replaying a level only adds stars above your best."

Group "Other ways to play":
1. "Daily. One puzzle a day, the same for everyone. Solve it on days in a row to build a streak.
   Opens after level 8."
2. "Relaxed. No clock, no stars, and you can't lose. Opens after level 8."

The helper levels, prices and the daily and relaxed unlock level are the GDD's `[GDD]`; if any
changes, change these lines too.
- **Empty state:** none; it is the same for every player.
- **Tall and wide:** the list simply gets longer or the column stays at most 480.
- **Back button:** goes back to where the player came from (Title, or Pause), section 4.2.

#### 3.13.4 Gifts at levels 50 and 100 (decided by Bart, 22 October 2026)

Reaching level 50 gives 2 Undos and 1 Extra slot, and reaching level 100 gives the same again.
These are the two steps where the game gets stricter (GDD), so help arrives with them.

- **When.** A gift is due when the player's next level is 50 (or 100) or higher and that gift has
  not been given yet. The usual moment is the clear screen of level 49 (or 99). Because it
  follows the player's progress and not a fixed screen, a player who was already past 50 when
  this was added gets it on their next numbered level clear. If both are due at once, one note
  shows the sum.
- **Where and how.** On the level clear screen, as a quiet plaque in the unlock note place
  (3.4, rect 32, 322, 296, 48): "A gift for reaching level 50: 2 Undos and 1 Extra slot." (or
  "level 100"). It fades in with the other clear screen items (150 ms), plays one soft clink,
  and has no button, no animation after that, no badge and no ask. The helpers are added to the
  player's counts at that moment and saved.
- **Dismissal.** None is needed. It stays until the player taps Next or Replay, like the unlock
  note. Back and every other button behave as on any clear screen.
- **Why not a sheet.** The first-time helper sheet needs a "Got it" tap, which would break "from
  level clear to the next level in one tap" (the fun checklist). A plaque keeps that tap and still
  tells the player. (The GDD suggested the sheet; this is the quieter alternative.)
- **On the next level.** The helper bar's count badges for Undo and Extra slot count up from the
  old number to the new one when the next level shows (one soft tick per step, 200 ms apart, once).
  No sheet and no highlight.
- **Never** in Relaxed (no gifts there), never on a replay of an earlier level once given, and
  never repeated: the save keeps one flag per gift. A progress reset clears the flags.
- **Coffee rule.** Nothing here asks the player for anything, so it is in keeping with ground
  rule 1: a gift is the game giving, and it never links anywhere.

## 4. Flows and the Android back button

### 4.1 Flow map

**The origin and the paused level.** Two ideas make the menus work with one dock.
- **Origin.** Every menu screen has an origin, the screen the player came from: the Title, or
  Pause (when they opened Settings from Pause). The dock's tabs **replace** the current menu
  screen and never add history, so Back always returns to the origin, not through every tab
  visited.
- **Paused level.** A level is paused from the moment the player opens Pause until they resume,
  retry, quit to title, start another level, or reset progress. While it is paused it stays in
  memory with everything intact (board, tray, clock, helpers, Extra slot). Opening Settings from
  Pause, then jumping between Settings, About, Info, Map, Stats and the title, never ends it.
  The game row and the title's Play button then read "Back to level", and a tap returns
  straight into the level with play continuing. A paused level is
  dropped, without a question, when the player: taps Quit to title; taps a node on the map or
  Daily or Relaxed, which starts a different level; resets progress; or the app is closed or
  killed (the level then restarts from the beginning, section 4.3). Helpers already spent stay
  spent (GDD R34, R36).

```
First launch or after reset (no level ever cleared)
    Level 1 (title skipped) -> Level clear -> Next -> Level 2 ...

Launch (later)
    Title   [menu frame: header, Play, Daily, Relaxed, tab row]
        Play     -> Level {n} (starts from the beginning)
                    or, if a level is paused, Back to level -> straight into that level
        Daily    -> Level (daily)       (locked until level 8 is cleared: toast only)
        Relaxed  -> Relaxed setup -> Level (relaxed)   (locked until level 8 is cleared)
        Coffee   -> phone browser (chip, top right; hidden in a store build)

Any menu screen (Title, Map, Stats, Info, Settings, About, License, Credits)
    Tab row: Home | Map | Stats | Info | Settings | About
        each tab replaces the current screen; Home is the title
    Game row (every menu screen except Title and Relaxed setup):
        "Play, Level {n}"          -> starts the player's next level
        "Back to level, paused"    -> straight into that level (play continues)
    Map      -> tap a cleared node: replay it | the next node: start it |
                a locked node: toast and knock | "Go to level" chip: scroll
    Settings -> dialog: reset
    About    -> License | Credits (sub pages; About tab or Back returns)
    Coffee chip (header; About has its own block) -> phone browser

Level
    -> Top bar cup (from level 4) -> Pause, then the phone browser (back to Pause on return)
    -> Pause -> Resume | Retry | Sound | Music | Settings | Quit to title | Coffee
         Settings (from Pause) -> menu frame with "Back to level" (into the level);
                                  Android Back returns to Pause
    -> Level clear -> Next | Replay (Done | Another for daily and relaxed)
    -> Out of room -> Retry | helpers owned | Previous level or Title
    -> Helper sheet (first time) -> Got it
    -> Buy dialog -> Get and use | Not now
```

### 4.2 Android back button on every screen

The back button and the back gesture do the same thing.

| Screen | Back does |
|-|-|
| Title | Exits the app. Everything is already saved. A paused level is not kept (4.3). |
| Level (playing) | Opens Pause. |
| Level (screwdriver mode) | Leaves the mode, keeps the helper. |
| Level (helper intro sheet) | Closes it, same as "Got it". |
| Level (buy dialog) | Closes it, same as "Not now". |
| Pause | Resumes. |
| Level clear | Goes to the title. |
| Out of room | Goes to the title. |
| Relaxed stuck sheet | Goes to the title. |
| Progress map, Stats, Info, Settings, About | Goes to the **origin**: Pause if the player came from Pause, otherwise the title. Tabs replace screens, so the player does not walk back through every tab. |
| Settings reset dialog | Closes it, nothing erased. |
| License, Credits | Goes back to About. |
| Relaxed setup | Goes to the title. |

Back never erases or spends anything. A level left unfinished starts again from its beginning
unless it is the paused level, which Back from the origin returns to.

### 4.3 Lifecycle

- The app losing focus or going to the background while a level is on the screen opens Pause (the
  clock stops). Returning shows Pause; the player taps Resume.
- **Links leave the app.** Opening the coffee page, the source code page or the email draft hands
  an address to the phone, so the app loses focus. On the level screen the only such control is
  the coffee cup in the top bar (1.7). Tapping it opens Pause first, in the same frame, so the
  level is paused and the clock stopped before the browser opens (and the normal focus loss rule
  above would pause it anyway). The same holds for the chip inside Pause. Coming back, the
  player is on the same Pause screen, the same level, still paused. From a menu screen the
  player simply returns to that screen.
- Progress and settings are written when the app is paused or loses focus, and at every level
  clear. The save holds only the player's current level number (and the rest of the progress),
  not the state of a board.
- **Decided by Bart:** quitting to the title, or the app being closed or killed in the middle of
  a level, brings the player back to the same level, started again from the beginning. The exact
  board is not kept. Retry is still free. (A level paused in memory while the player visits
  Settings, About or Info is the one exception, and only while the app stays alive.)
- Date change during a daily: the daily keeps the date it started on; solving it counts for
  that date.

### 4.4 Speed targets

- **Next from level clear:** one tap. The next level is generated while the player plays, so
  Next starts the level immediately: the old board slides out left (200 ms) while the new one
  slides in (250 ms), playable from the first frame of the slide.
- **Retry after a loss:** under two seconds from the losing tap (section 3.5). Retry itself is
  one tap, and the level is playable 400 ms after it.
- **Retry from pause:** one tap, playable in 400 ms.
- **Cold start to playing** on a returning player: title is up in the time it takes to draw it;
  Play to the first tappable screw in under one second (the level is generated in the
  background while the title is showing).

## 5. The first-time experience

**Goal:** level 1 cleared in under 30 seconds, with no reading.

### 5.1 First launch

1. The app opens straight into level 1. No title, no menu, no text.
2. The board fades in over 400 ms. Level 1 is the GDD's: one bar with three screws of one color
   and one box, so three taps finish it (GDD section 8).
3. After 500 ms a **hand** (a pointing hand drawn in code) glides to the first screw to tap and
   makes a small press, over a cycle of about 1.2 seconds, repeating until the player taps it.
   After the player taps a screw, the hand glides to the next screw in the tutorial data's
   `hint` list (GDD 9.3; for level 1 the left, right, then middle screw, so the bar never swings).
4. The player taps. The screw spins out (ratchet, pop), flies into the box (clink). Three taps and
   the box closes (lid sound, slide away), then the clear screen: the stars pop and Next waits.
5. Next goes to level 2.

Estimated time for an attentive new player: about 10 to 15 seconds. The hand reappears after
8 seconds without a tap in any level that has a hand, so a player who looks away is never lost.

### 5.2 Rules for tutorial levels

- The first eight levels teach one idea each (GDD section 8, confirmed against the lines below).
- Each has at most one short line, at most 8 words where possible. The line sits in the helper
  bar position (3.2.2) in a plaque, in the Tutorial line style (18 bold). It shows from the start
  of the level and stays until the level ends. It never blocks the board.
- A tutorial line may be accompanied by the hand and by a steady ring around the relevant thing,
  never by anything flashing.
- Level 1 shows no line at all. After 8 seconds with no tap, it shows "Tap a screw." (this is
  the only text a player might ever see on level 1).
- A player can lose a tutorial level; the same loss sheet is used.
- The timer, pips and star bank stay hidden until level 4 (3.2.2).
- Each line belongs to one tutorial level. Replaying that level from the progress map shows the
  line again, which is fine.

### 5.3 Tutorial lines

These match the lines in GDD section 8 word for word (checked after Hard Stop 1). The level
numbers are the GDD's. Where the hand points is set by each level's `hint` list in the GDD
(section 8, last column); the table here only says what the line teaches.

| Level | Idea | Line |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Tap a screw | no line (after 8 s idle: "Tap a screw.") |
| 2 | Screws go to their box | "Screws fly to the box of their color." |
| 3 | The tray | "No open box? The screw waits in the tray." |
| 4 | Covered screws | "Covered screws are stuck. Free the plank on top." |
| 5 | A plank falls | "Take out every screw and the plank falls." |
| 6 | A plank swings | "With one screw left, a plank swings." |
| 7 | The box queue | "The next boxes are shown. Plan ahead." (a steady ring around the preview, no hand) |
| 8 | The first helper (Undo) | "Tapped the wrong one? Try Undo." (after the helper sheet, with a steady ring on the Undo button, no hand) |

- The covered screw line is 8 words, the longest. Any line may wrap to two lines at 18 units in
  the 336 wide plaque.
- No tutorial line uses a number.

## 6. Feedback for every input

Rule for all of this section: the first visible response starts within one frame (about 16
ms); every response of every kind has started within **100 ms** of the touch. The sound starts
at the same moment as the first motion. Sounds come from the audio set in the brief; a button
press uses the knock sound at low volume and a higher pitch, so no extra sound is needed. Sound
is never the only signal: each row has motion, and sound adds to it.

Screws and the board act on **touch down**. Buttons act on release (with the pressed state on
touch down).

### 6.1 The board

| Input | What moves | Sound | Starts within |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tap a free screw, a box with a free slot of its color is open | the head lifts 4 units and turns; after 120 ms the screw rises and flies in a curve (about 350 ms) to the free slot, still turning; on landing the well pops (scale 1.0 to 1.15 and back in 150 ms) | ratchet, then pop as it comes free, clink on landing | 16 ms |
| Tap a free screw, no matching open box | same turn and flight, to the leftmost free tray slot; the slot pops on landing | ratchet, pop, clink (duller than the box clink) | 16 ms |
| The tray reaches one free slot `[C:tray]` | the free slot nudges (scale 1.0 to 1.08 and back in 300 ms) and the warning state shows (3.2.2) | one gentle tick, once | at landing |
| A box's last slot fills `[C:slots]` | the lid closes (200 ms); then the box slides out (300 ms) and the next one slides in (300 ms) with a small bounce; the preview boxes slide one place and a new one appears | lid sound | at landing |
| New box arrives and the tray holds matching screws | each matching tray screw jumps to the box in tray order, 120 ms apart, in an arc | a clink per screw, rising a little in pitch | at the slide in |
| A plank loses its last screw | it hangs for 80 ms, then falls off the board with a turn and goes out of sight; a soft dust puff appears where it fell | wooden knock | at the tap |
| A plank is down to one screw | it swings about that screw to its resting angle, a damped swing of about 0.7 seconds with a little overshoot | soft creak | at the tap |
| Newly freed or newly covered screws | change from covered styling to free styling (or the reverse) at the moment of the tap, not partway through the swing | none | at the tap |
| Tap a **covered** screw | the plank in front of it wiggles (plus and minus 3 degrees, two cycles, 220 ms); the covered screw's ghost ring brightens steadily for 600 ms and the covering plank's edge glows steadily for 600 ms (no pulsing) | a dull knock | 16 ms |
| Tap a free screw that has **nowhere to go** (GDD R25: the tray is full and no open box of its color has room, while some other free screw does fit) | the screw lifts 3 units, turns back about 30 degrees and settles in its hole (160 ms, it never leaves); the tray frame nudges sideways 4 units, twice (200 ms); the free screws that do fit an open box get a steady ring for 1 second (fades in and out over 150 ms each, no pulsing); the toast shows "The tray is full. Tap a screw that fits an open box." | a dull knock, lower than the covered screw knock | 16 ms |
| Tap a plank where there is no screw | the plank presses in by 2 units and returns (120 ms) | a faint tap | 16 ms |
| Tap the back board where there is nothing | a soft ring spreads from the touch (250 ms, fades) | a faint tick | 16 ms |
| Tap anywhere after the level is cleared or lost | nothing | none | |

- **The board's touch area is the board panel rectangle only** (3.2.1; scaled by b in 3.2.1a).
  The top bar, the boxes row, the tray and the helper bar are separate controls. A touch that
  starts in one of them never reaches the board, and a touch that starts on the board never
  reaches them. The coffee cup in the top bar (1.7) has exactly its own 48 x 48 target, no
  snapping, no larger area, and it acts on release only when the touch began on it. The nearest
  screw target is at least 126 units below it.
- Hit testing: a free screw is hit by a circle of radius 24 around its center. If circles from
  two free screws could meet, the one with the nearer center wins (but the spacing rule keeps
  that from happening). If no free screw is hit, a covered screw hit by the same circle makes
  its frontmost covering plank wiggle. Otherwise the tap hits the plank or the board.
- **Taps during animations are accepted.** The logic runs on each tap at once, in tap order.
  Every screw in flight keeps flying; a new tap starts a new flight without waiting. The slot or
  tray place is decided by the logic at the tap, not when the earlier flights land. A quick
  player can tap the next screw while the last one is still flying.
- **A refused tap changes nothing.** It is not a tray use, it does not start the timer, and
  nothing is spent. The player can tap another screw at once.
- **Double taps** on the same screw: the second tap is ignored because the screw is already
  gone.
- **Tapping the pause button during a flight** pauses everything; flights finish when the
  player resumes.

### 6.2 Helpers

| Input | What moves | Sound | Starts within |
|-|-|-|-|
| Undo tap | the last action (a tap or a Screwdriver removal) reverses: the screw reverses its flight (350 ms) from its box or the tray slot back to its hole, turning backwards; a fallen plank rises back onto the board; a closed box (lid shut) reopens and slides back; a swung plank swings back to where it was | a soft reverse of the ratchet | 16 ms |
| Extra slot tap | a new tray slot grows in on the right (250 ms), the frame widens by 50 (to 210, 260 or 310 slots wide) and re-centers, and the warning clears if there are now two free slots | a small wooden pop | 16 ms |
| Screwdriver tap | a banner slides in over the helper bar (150 ms); all screws show their symbols bright | soft tick | 16 ms |
| Screwdriver then a screw with nowhere to go | the screw shakes back as in the refused tap above; the mode stays; the toast "That screw has nowhere to go." | a dull knock | 16 ms |
| Screwdriver then screw tap | the screwdriver icon touches the screw (100 ms), then the screw rises through the planks above it (it is drawn on top of everything) and flies as usual | ratchet, pop, clink | 16 ms |
| Helper button at count 0, can pay | the buy dialog fades in (150 ms) | soft tick | 16 ms |
| Helper button at count 0, cannot pay | the button shakes 4 units sideways, twice, in 200 ms; the toast shows | a dull knock | 16 ms |
| "Get and use" tap | the star bank number counts down by the price (400 ms); then the helper acts as above | per helper | 16 ms |

### 6.3 Buttons and controls

| Input | What moves | Sound | Starts within |
|-|-|-|-|
| Any button press (down) | scales to 0.96 and darkens | the low knock at low volume | 16 ms |
| Any button release on the button | the action runs; the button returns to size | none extra | at release |
| Press, slide away, release | the button returns and nothing happens | none | |
| Toggle (sound, music, symbols) | the knob slides across (120 ms) and the word On or Off changes | a tick, except when turning Sound off | 16 ms |
| Swatch tap (free) | the check mark moves to it; the board sample updates | a tick | 16 ms |
| Swatch tap (locked) | the swatch shakes 4 units, twice; the caption names the unlock | a dull knock | 16 ms |
| List scroll | follows the finger; momentum slows it | none | immediate |
| Level cell tap | the cell presses; the level slides in | knock | 16 ms |
| Link buttons | the pressed state; the phone opens the other app | none | at release |

### 6.4 Moments

| Moment | What moves | Sound |
|-|-|-|
| Level starts | the planks drop in (staggered, 300 ms total), the timer waits for the first action | a soft wood tap per plank at low volume |
| Level cleared | see 3.4; the stars pop; no flash, no strobing | short chime, rising |
| Out of room | the tray slots shake 6 units sideways for 250 ms; the sheet slides up after 300 ms | a soft falling tone |
| Pause | the screen covers in 150 ms | none |

The celebration uses color and shape from the graphic designer's direction, but nothing in it
flashes (section 7.5).

## 7. Accessibility

### 7.1 One-handed portrait

- Every screen works with one thumb, in portrait only.
- The bottom half (y 300 and below in content coordinates) holds every primary action:
  Play, Next, Retry, Resume, the three difficulties, Got it, Get and use, the helper bar, and
  the nav dock of every menu screen (the way back to the game and to every other screen).
- The pause button is in the top right and is the only frequently used control above the
  bottom half. It is deliberately a little away from the thumb to prevent accidental pauses,
  and the Android back button does the same job from anywhere.
- No gesture is required: no swipes, no pinch, no long press, no hold, no double tap. Scroll
  areas scroll by drag, and have every function reachable without scrolling to find a hidden
  control.

### 7.2 Contrast and text

- Text contrast is at least **4.5 to 1** against its plaque, for all text including captions and
  disabled labels' text where it carries meaning. The graphic designer's script checks every
  text and plaque pair listed here:
  primary label on primary button, secondary label on secondary button, quiet button label on
  its plaque, body on panel, caption on panel, tutorial line on its plaque, timer on top bar,
  star bank number on top bar, helper name on helper button, badge number on badge, toast text
  on toast, danger label on danger button, caption text on the picker plaque, text on the
  sheet and dialog panels, and legal text on its plaque.
- Non-text elements that carry meaning (icons, switch outlines, star outlines, the focus ring,
  the warning triangle, the padlock, the check mark) have at least **3 to 1** against what is
  behind them.
- Text sits on a plaque, never straight on wood.
- Minimum text size is 13 units (section 1.3).

### 7.3 Touch targets

- Every control has a target at least **48 x 48 units**. Where a visible control is smaller (the
  coffee chip, the pause icon, swatches) the target is still 48 by 48. Dock tabs are 56 x 52,
  the game row is 336 x 52, and map nodes are 64 to 80 across.
- Neighboring targets are at least 8 units apart, and a danger button is at least 16 units from
  the nearest other button.
- **A free screw's target never overlaps another free screw's.** Because every pair of screws
  is at least 48 units apart (3.2.1, decided by Bart), circles of radius 24 never meet in any
  state. A test checks it on the level data (section 8).
- Targets are the same size for left and right hands; nothing depends on handedness.

### 7.4 Color is never the only signal

| Signal | Color | Also |
|-|-|-|
| Screw color | the screw's color | a symbol on the head (on by default) |
| Box color | the box body | the same symbol on the box and on the preview |
| Free or covered | opacity differences | shading and shadow on free, dashed ring and flat on covered |
| Tray warning | warm tone | a triangle with an exclamation mark in the free slot, and a tick sound |
| Star earned | warm fill | filled shape versus outline, and caption text |
| Toggle state | switch color | the words "On" and "Off" and the knob position |
| Selected swatch | outline | check mark |
| Locked swatch | dimmed | padlock icon and caption |
| Pips | fill | filled shape versus outline |
| Active dock tab | raised plaque | a 3 unit bar above the label and a bold label |
| Map node states | badge color | stars filled or outline, play triangle, padlock, size and border |
| Danger button | red tone | the label "Erase everything" and its position below the safe choice |

- **Sound is never the only signal** either: every sound has a matching motion or change.
- **Colorblind symbols are on by default.** Each screw color has one symbol (circle, triangle,
  square, star, diamond, cross, ring, bar and so on; the graphic designer assigns them in
  docs/DESIGN.md). The symbol is the same on screws, boxes and the box preview: at least 16
  units on a 28 unit head, 14 on the front of an open box, 20 on a preview box, with strokes of
  at least 2 units. In the Workshop look the symbol is cut into the head as its drive recess, so
  no separate slot or cross can hide it, and it rotates with the screw. With symbols off every
  head gets a plain cross. Settings can turn symbols off.

### 7.5 Nothing flashes

- No element changes brightness more than three times in any one second, and in practice
  nothing changes brightness more than once a second.
- No full screen or large area flash, in celebrations, in the loss, or when a box closes.
- No strobing particles. Particle effects fade in and out over at least 120 ms.
- The tutorial hand, pulses and rings are steady or move slowly (one cycle per 1.2 seconds or
  slower).
- The tray warning is a steady state, not a blink.

### 7.6 Other

- **No time pressure.** The clock only changes the speed star. A level can never be lost to
  time.
- **No fine motor demands.** No drag is needed to play the board; the player only taps.
- **Text for screen readers.** Where the engine supports it, every control carries its visible
  label as its accessible name (for example the pause button is "Pause", the pause icon needs no
  other text). The board is not described to screen readers in v1.
- **System settings.** Android's font scale does not change canvas text in this engine setup;
  the type sizes in 1.3 are the guarantee.

## 8. What this file needs from the other roles

For the lead to pass on.

- **game-designer:** the GDD already gives the helper levels (8, 15, 25), the timer level (4),
  the tutorial lines, the band names, the unlocks, and the 48 unit spacing for every pair of
  screws, and this file now matches. Say if any count in section 2 changes.
- **level-engine-dev:** a test that every pair of screws on every generated and tutorial level
  is at least 48 units apart (screws never move, so this covers every state and rest pose). The
  tutorial `hint` list is in GDD 9.3. The logic needs to report whether a screw has a
  destination (for the refused tap, R25, and for the Screwdriver on the out of room sheet).
- **graphic-designer:** works from this file's rects (at b = 1 and f = 1; the level screen is
  drawn at any b from 1.0 to 2.0 and f from 0.7 to 1.167, and needs a back panel that works behind
  a rail as well as behind a stack). Provide the symbols, the hand, the star,
  the cup, the padlock, the warning triangle, the pause icon, and the helper icons. Contrast
  script pairs in 7.2. Covered screw styling per 3.2.2. Nothing flashes (7.5).
- **gameplay-dev:** hit testing and feedback per 6.1 and 6.2, the timer per 3.2.2, the hand and
  idle hint per section 5. The board view takes a scale b from the layout (3.2.1a); hit testing
  and the 24 unit target radius work in core coordinates and are scaled with it.
- **ui-dev:** every screen outside the level; back button table in 4.2; license and credits
  content in 3.10 and 3.11; links per 3.9; saving per 4.3. The level screen's layout rule
  (inputs Wc, Hc, dpu; outputs b, f, stacked or split) is in 3.2.1a, and needs the safe area
  and the device's dp per unit.
- **audio-dev:** sound list is the brief's; a button press reuses the knock quietly.
- **New from 22 October 2026 (Phase 5):**
  - **gameplay-dev:** the tray takes its slot count from the level (3.2.2): tutorial 5, levels 9
    to 11 five, 12 to 20 four, 21 and up three, daily three, Relaxed five `[GDD]`; Extra slot
    adds one; the tray frame and the slot layout per the table in 3.2.2 (frame centered, widths
    160, 210, 260 and 310); the warning at exactly one free slot, tick at most once per 2
    seconds; the shrink line and the tray closing (3.2.2); the Extra slot row in 6.2.
  - **ui-dev:** the gift plaque on the clear screen and the badge count up (3.13.4); the flags in
    the save (shrink line shown, gift 50 given, gift 100 given); prices 3, 5 and 8 everywhere;
    the changed Info lines (3.14).
  - **level-engine-dev and the game designer:** tray size by level and for the daily and Relaxed
    is a rule of the logic and the GDD (the tray size in R1, R2 and R30, which still say 5 and a
    sixth slot); the gifts and prices belong in data/tuning.json (GDD 6.8).
  - **graphic-designer:** the tray frame at 3, 4, 5 and 6 slots (one steel tray with riveted ends
    that can be drawn at any of those widths), the slot closing animation and its steady
    outline, and a gift plaque in the Workshop look.
- **New from 21 October 2026:**
  - **ui-dev:** the menu frame and nav dock (1.6) as one shared component used by every menu
    screen; the origin and paused level model (4.1); Settings from Pause (3.3); the progress map
    (3.6) as a recycled or custom drawn trail; the Info screen (3.14); the coffee chip in the
    header and in Pause, and one `Links.coffee_visible()` switch (1.7), with a test that builds
    every screen with it off; the renamed Map tab (the old Levels list is gone).
  - **gameplay-dev:** keep a paused level alive while the menus are open (the level scene or its
    state is held, not freed). "Back to level" returns straight into the level and the clock
    restarts when the board is showing, not before. The coffee cup in the top bar (from level 4)
    opens Pause first and then asks the app flow to open the address; the board listens only
    inside its panel rectangle (6.1); the cup is hidden while the clear screen, the out of room
    sheet, a sheet or a dialog shows.
  - **graphic-designer:** the dock (six tab icons: house, trail of dots, bar chart, "i" in a
    circle, gear, screw head; the active tab look; the brass game row), the new title layout (the
    four small buttons are gone, the decoration is bigger, 3.1), the map badges in four states
    (cleared, hard, next, locked), star pips, a padlock, solid and dashed connectors, the top fade
    of the trail and the "Go to level" chip, all cheap to draw (a pool of about 20 nodes on screen,
    no per node shader cost); the coffee chip in the Workshop look; and the Info icons. Everything
    in code, nothing flashes.
  - **platform-dev:** the `no_coffee` custom feature in the store export preset (1.7), and the
    privacy policy, the store listing and the link list with the coffee button hidden.
  - **level-engine-dev and the save:** the map needs the best star count per level (already in
    the progress save) and the highest cleared level; nothing new to store.

## 9. Review checklist (used on screenshots)

1. Level screen at 360 x 640 and 360 x 800 matches the budget tables.
2. The board core is 344 x 360 in core coordinates; no screw is outside the inset rectangle. The
   drawn board matches the b of 3.2.1a for the screenshot's size.
3. Every control is at least 48 x 48 units (at least 48 dp where f is below 1); free screws'
   targets do not overlap.
4. Text is at least 13 units and on a plaque; contrast numbers pass.
5. Primary buttons are in the bottom half; the nav dock is at the bottom of every menu screen.
6. Symbols appear on screws, boxes and the preview by default.
7. A covered screw tap wiggles the right plank within 100 ms.
8. The tray warning shows at one free slot (with the triangle).
9. Level clear: Next is tappable at 500 ms; the celebration is under 2 seconds; no flashing.
10. Out of room: says "The tray is full"; Retry is the biggest button; Retry to playing is
    under 2 seconds.
11. Every string matches this file word for word; no em dashes, no double hyphens.
12. Back button table in 4.2 holds on every screen.
13. Safe areas: nothing under a notch or gesture bar.
14. Tablet and foldable: the board is scaled uniformly (never stretched) as in 3.2.1a, bars and
    rail are composed, other screens use a column of at most 480.
15. Level 1 clears in under 30 seconds with no reading.
16. The nav dock is identical on every menu screen, the active tab is clear, and "Back to level"
    or "Play" is one tap away from each of them.
17. The coffee chip is top right on the title, Pause, the map, Stats, Info and Settings; on the
    level screen only the cup at the far left of the top bar shows (from level 4), 256 units from
    Pause and more than 126 units from any screw target; nothing coffee shows on levels 1 to
    3, on level clear, on out of room or over a sheet; every screen looks right with the coffee
    switch off (the top bar goes back to its no cup layout).
18. Settings opens from Pause and returns to the same paused level with nothing lost.
19. The progress map opens centered on the next level, shows 4 locked levels, and answers a
    locked tap with the knock and "Clear level {n} first."; it scrolls smoothly at level 500.
20. Checked at both Fold5 sizes: folded 360 x 922 and opened 533 x 640.
21. The tray has 5 slots through level 11, 4 on levels 12 to 20, 3 from 21 and in the daily; the
    steel frame is centered and the box row and targets do not move; with Extra slot it is one
    slot wider and the warning follows the new count.
22. The shrink line shows once, at level 12, in the helper bar place, and never again; the gift
    note shows once at 50 and once at 100 on the clear screen, with no button.

## 10. Decided by Bart

1. **Quitting or being killed mid-level.** The player comes back to the same level, started
   again from the beginning. The exact board is not kept. Retry is still free. The save only
   needs the current level number. (Sections 3.3, 4.1, 4.3.)
2. **A brand new player skips the title and opens straight into level 1.** Approved. (Section 5.)
3. **The fixed board core is approved**: 344 x 360 units, the same level geometry on every
   device. On big phones, unfolded foldables and tablets the board view scales up uniformly to
   fill the board panel, and touch targets scale with it. (Section 3.2.1a.)
4. **Buying a helper from its button.** A tap on a helper with count 0 offers "Get and use" for
   stars. It happens only on the player's tap. (Sections 3.2.2, 3.13.3.)
5. **Out of room offers only helpers the player owns** (Undo, Extra slot, and Screwdriver if
   owned). It never offers to buy one. (Section 3.5.)
6. **Relaxed shows only the free Undo** and hides Extra slot and Screwdriver. (Section 3.2.2.)
7. **The speed and clean markers next to the timer stay.** They get checked at Gate 1.
   (Section 3.2.2.)
8. **Pause covers the board.** (Section 3.3.)
9. **The Buy me a coffee chip goes top right on the title screen.** (Section 3.1.)
10. **Spacing: every pair of screws is at least 48 units apart**, in every state including rest
    poses. This replaces the earlier rule of 48 for free screws and 32 for any pair. (Section
    3.2.1.)
11. **The timer starts at the first action**, including using a helper (GDD S6). (Section 3.2.2.)
12. **Undo costs the Clean star** (any helper does, GDD R32). **Daily and Relaxed open after
    level 8**, so the title shows them locked with a note before then. (Sections 3.1, 3.2.2.)
13. **Look direction: Workshop.** Box layout settled for it in 3.2.2 (wells on top, painted front
    band with the symbol, lid leaning back above).
14. **Four requests from Bart after playing Phase 3 on a Galaxy Z Fold5, 21 October 2026.**
    - **A coffee button that is easy to find.** On the title, the play screen (see 15 below),
      Settings, Info and, by the shared frame, the map and Stats; About keeps its Supporting
      block. No pop-ups, badges, counters, reminders or animation. One switch can hide every one
      of them in a store build. (Section 1.7.)
    - **Settings while playing.** One tap from Pause; it returns to the same paused level with
      nothing lost. (Section 3.3.)
    - **One navigation bar on every menu screen.** A bottom dock with six tabs and a game row,
      so from any menu screen one tap goes to any other and one tap gets back to the game: the
      paused level if there is one, otherwise Play with the next level. (Sections 1.6, 4.1, 4.2.)
    - **A progress map in place of the plain levels list.** A scrolling trail of nodes with
      stars, opening centered on the next level, with a few locked levels beyond. Tapping a
      cleared level replays it. (Section 3.6.)
15. **Coffee on the level screen goes in the top bar,** not only inside Pause (21 October 2026).
    It is an icon only cup at the far left of the top bar, as safe as possible: 256 units from
    Pause, more than 126 units from any screw target, the board's touch area stopping short of
    it, quiet with no animation, and a tap pauses the level before the browser opens. It also
    stays as a chip in Pause. (Sections 1.7, 3.2.2, 3.3, 4.3, 6.1.)
16. **Info is "How to play"** (21 October 2026). Confirmed. (Section 3.14.)
17. **"Back to level" goes straight into the level,** not to Pause first (21 October 2026). The
    clock starts again when the board is showing. (Sections 1.6, 4.1.)

18. **The tray shrinks, helpers get new prices, gifts at 50 and 100 (22 October 2026).**
    - **Tray size:** 5 slots up to level 11, 4 on levels 12 to 20, 3 from level 21. The tutorial
      keeps 5 and the daily has 3. (Section 3.2.2.)
    - **The shrink line:** the first time the tray shrinks (level 12) one short line shows, once
      only: "The tray is smaller now. Every slot counts." (Section 3.2.2.)
    - **New prices:** Undo 3 stars, Extra slot 5, Screwdriver 8. (Sections 3.2.2, 3.13, 3.14.)
    - **Gifts:** reaching level 50, and again level 100, gives 2 Undos and 1 Extra slot, shown
      quietly on the level clear screen. (Section 3.13.4.)

## 11. Open questions and notes for the lead

**For Bart:**
1. **Privacy wording for a store build with the coffee button hidden.** Left open on purpose, for
   Phase 7. The fixed sentence names the button. I propose "WoodLogic collects nothing: no ads,
   no tracking, no internet. The game itself sends nothing." for that build only. It is fixed
   wording in CLAUDE.md, so it needs your approval before the store build.

**Pending for Phase 5:**
- **Relaxed tray size.** The game designer is deciding whether Relaxed keeps 5 slots. This file
  assumes 5 until the GDD says otherwise (3.2.2).
- **Daily with 3 slots at level 9.** The daily opens after level 8 and always has 3 slots, so a
  player can meet a 3 slot tray in the daily before they reach level 12. The shrink line belongs
  to the numbered levels and never shows in the daily. Worth checking at Gate 2 that this does
  not confuse.

**Choices I made that are easy to undo:**
- The gift is a quiet plaque on the clear screen, not the first-time helper sheet the GDD
  suggested, so Next stays one tap.
- The shrink line replaces the helper buttons for 2.5 to 6 seconds (the clock has not started),
  because the board and tray must stay uncovered.
- The title's four small buttons (Levels, Stats, Settings, About) are now tabs in the dock, so
  the title shows Play, Daily and Relaxed with a bigger decoration.
- The top bar cup is hidden on levels 1 to 3 (it appears with the timer and pips at level 4),
  so a brand new player's first minute has nothing to read or be asked. Say if you want it from
  level 1.
- Stats and the progress map get the coffee chip too, because the header is shared. Say if you
  want it only on the screens you named.
- Starting another level from the map while a level is paused drops the paused level without a
  question (Retry is free, and a confirmation would slow the map down).

**Conflicts and gaps in other documents (not edited by me):**
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md says the game hands three fixed addresses to the phone and lists
  `src/ui/links.gd` as the only `OS.shell_open` site. With the coffee switch off it is two; the
  switch (1.7) and its test need adding to the architecture, and the security reviewer should
  check that `open_coffee` refuses when hidden.
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (Phase 3, section 10) calls the screen "Levels list"; it is now the
  progress map ("Map" tab). The GDD's mentions of Daily and Relaxed locks are unchanged.
- docs/GDD.md R36 (quit mid level restarts) still holds. The paused level in memory (4.1) is
  not a mid level save, but the app flow must keep the level scene alive while menus are open,
  which the Phase 3 `app_flow.gd` was not built to do (its Pause only has Resume, Retry and Quit).
- CLAUDE.md fixed wording for Privacy names the coffee button (see my note 3).
