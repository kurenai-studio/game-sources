-- Online racing through the UDP relay in server/. A host opens a room and up to
-- three others join with its code, or the relay makes a room for whoever is
-- looking (quick match) and picks its race. The seat numbers come from the relay,
-- and the lowest seat in the room is the leader: it sets the race and calls the
-- start, which in a quick match is when the relay's countdown runs out.
--
-- Nothing here waits for an answer. Everyone repeats their state four times a
-- second until it stops mattering, so a lost packet costs a quarter of a second
-- and there are no acknowledgements to track.
--
-- Packets only ever grow at the end. Every reader takes the fields it knows and
-- ignores any after them, and ignores packets it doesn't know, so a later 3.x game
-- can add to the protocol without leaving earlier ones behind. See FEATURES.
